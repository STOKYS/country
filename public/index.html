                        <h1>West Germany</h1>
                        <p>West Germany, officially called the <b>Federal Republic of Germany</b> ("Bundesrepublik
                            Deutschland" in german). It was formed on <b>May 23rd 1949</b>, after the splitting of Nazi
                            Germany into four sectors (Under the rule of <b>Allies</b>)</p>
                        <p>West Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany[a] (FRG; German: Bundesrepublik
                            Deutschland [ˈbʊndəsʁepuˌbliːk ˈdɔʏtʃlant] (About this soundlisten)), retrospectively
                            designated as the Bonn Republic, is the common English name for the Federal Republic of
                            Germany between its formation on 23 May 1949 and the German reunification through the
                            accession of East Germany on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War period, the western
                            portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc. West Germany was formed as a political
                            entity during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, established from eleven
                            states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States, the United
                            Kingdom and France. Its provisional capital was the city of Bonn.</p>

                            <p>At the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided between the Western and Eastern blocs.
                            Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories, the Saarland
                            and a divided Berlin. Initially, West Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of
                            Germany, identifying as the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871–1945
                            German Reich. It took the line that the German Democratic Republic (GDR), commonly referred
                            to as East Germany, was an illegally constituted puppet state controlled by the Soviet
                            Union.</p>

                            <p>Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-Württemberg in 1952, and the
                            Saarland joined West Germany in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, West Berlin
                            was considered an unofficial de facto eleventh state. While legally not part of West
                            Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the Allied Control Council, West Berlin
                            politically aligned with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its
                            federal institutions.</p>

                            <p>The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the
                            economic miracle of the 1950s (Wirtschaftswunder), when West Germany rose from the enormous
                            destruction wrought by World War II to become the world's third-largest economy. The first
                            chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who remained in office until 1963, worked for a full alignment
                            with NATO rather than neutrality, and secured membership in the military alliance. Adenauer
                            was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day European Union. When
                            the G6 was established in 1975, there was no serious debate as to whether West Germany would
                            become a member.</p>

                            <p>Following the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the
                            opening of the Berlin Wall, both territories took action to achieve German reunification.
                            East Germany voted to dissolve and accede to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990. Its
                            five post-war states (Länder) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin, which
                            ended its special status and formed an additional Land. They formally joined the federal
                            republic on 3 October 1990, raising the total number of states from ten to sixteen, and
                            ending the division of Germany. The reunited Germany is the direct continuation of the state
                            previously informally called West Germany and not a new state, as the process was
                            essentially a voluntary act of accession: West Germany was enlarged to include the
                            additional states of East Germany, which had ceased to exist. The expanded federal republic
                            retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in
                            international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation
                            to Western alliances such as the United Nations, NATO, OECD, and the European Economic
                            Community.</p>

                                <p>The ruling communist party, known as the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED),
                                    formed in April 1946 from the merger between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD)
                                    and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).[33] The two former parties were
                                    notorious rivals when they were active before the Nazis consolidated all power and
                                    criminalised them, and official East German and Soviet histories portrayed this
                                    merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties and symbolic of
                                    the new friendship of German socialists after defeating their common enemy; however,
                                    there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than commonly portrayed,
                                    and that the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD's
                                    eastern branch to merge with the KPD, and the communists, who held a majority, had
                                    virtually total control over policy.[34] The SED remained the ruling party for the
                                    entire duration of the East German state. It had close ties with the Soviets, which
                                    maintained military forces in East Germany until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991
                                    (the Russian Federation continued to maintain forces in the territory of the former
                                    East Germany until 1994), with the stated purpose of countering NATO bases in West
                                    Germany.</p>

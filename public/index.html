                        pronounced [ˌdeːdeːˈʔɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), was a country that existed from 1949 to
                        1990, the period when the eastern portion of Germany was part of the Eastern Bloc during the
                        Cold War. Commonly described as a communist state in English usage, it described itself as a
                        socialist "workers' and peasants' state".[7] It consisted of territory that was administered
                        and
                        occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II—the Soviet occupation zone of
                        the
                        Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the Oder–Neisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded
                        West
                        Berlin but did not include it and West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR.</p>

                                Deutschland [ˈbʊndəsʁepuˌbliːk ˈdɔʏtʃlant] (About this soundlisten)), retrospectively
                                designated as the Bonn Republic, is the common English name for the Federal Republic of
                                Germany between its formation on 23 May 1949 and the German reunification through the
                                accession of East Germany on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War period, the western
                                portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc. West Germany was formed as a political
                                entity during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, established from
                                eleven
                                states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States, the
                                United
                                Kingdom and France. Its provisional capital was the city of Bonn.</p>

                            <p>At the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided between the Western and Eastern blocs.
                                Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories, the
                                Saarland
                                and a divided Berlin. Initially, West Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of
                                Germany, identifying as the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the
                                1871–1945
                                German Reich. It took the line that the German Democratic Republic (GDR), commonly
                                referred
                                to as East Germany, was an illegally constituted puppet state controlled by the Soviet
                                Union.</p>

                            <p>Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-Württemberg in 1952, and
                                the
                                Saarland joined West Germany in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, West
                                Berlin
                                was considered an unofficial de facto eleventh state. While legally not part of West
                                Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the Allied Control Council, West Berlin
                                politically aligned with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its
                                federal institutions.</p>

                            <p>The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the
                                economic miracle of the 1950s (Wirtschaftswunder), when West Germany rose from the
                                enormous
                                destruction wrought by World War II to become the world's third-largest economy. The
                                first
                                chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who remained in office until 1963, worked for a full
                                alignment
                                with NATO rather than neutrality, and secured membership in the military alliance.
                                Adenauer
                                was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day European Union.
                                When
                                the G6 was established in 1975, there was no serious debate as to whether West Germany
                                would
                                become a member.</p>

                            <p>Following the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by
                                the
                                opening of the Berlin Wall, both territories took action to achieve German
                                reunification.
                                East Germany voted to dissolve and accede to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990.
                                Its
                                five post-war states (Länder) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin, which
                                ended its special status and formed an additional Land. They formally joined the federal
                                republic on 3 October 1990, raising the total number of states from ten to sixteen, and
                                ending the division of Germany. The reunited Germany is the direct continuation of the
                                state
                                previously informally called West Germany and not a new state, as the process was
                                essentially a voluntary act of accession: West Germany was enlarged to include the
                                additional states of East Germany, which had ceased to exist. The expanded federal
                                republic
                                retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in
                                international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and
                                affiliation
                                to Western alliances such as the United Nations, NATO, OECD, and the European Economic
                                Community.</p>

                            <p>The West German Wirtschaftswunder ("economic miracle", coined by The Times) began in
                                1950.
                                This
                                improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the Reichsmark
                                with
                                the
                                Deutsche Mark and halted rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German
                                coal
                                and
                                steel industry finally ended in 1950.</p>


                            <p>The Volkswagen Beetle – for many years the most successful car in the world – on the
                                assembly
                                line in Wolfsburg factory, 1973
                                As demand for consumer goods increased after World War II, the resulting shortage helped
                                overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany
                                had a
                                large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion
                                of
                                Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This
                                helped
                                Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these
                                factors,
                                hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and
                                1960s
                                extra labour supplied by thousands of Gastarbeiter ("guest workers") provided a vital
                                base
                                for
                                the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German
                                governments
                                as
                                they tried to assimilate this group of workers.[142]</p>

                            <p>With the dropping of Allied reparations, the freeing of German intellectual property and
                                the
                                impact of the Marshall Plan stimulus, West Germany developed one of the strongest
                                economies
                                in
                                the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy
                                showed a
                                certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued
                                reparations
                                to
                                the USSR.[143]</p>

                            <p>In 1952, West Germany became part of the European Coal and Steel Community, which would
                                later
                                evolve into the European Union. On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared to have the
                                "authority
                                of a sovereign state".[b] The British, French and U.S. militaries remained in the
                                country,
                                just
                                as the Soviet Army remained in East Germany. Four days after obtaining the "authority of
                                a
                                sovereign state" in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The UK and the USA retained an
                                especially
                                strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In
                                1976
                                West Germany became one of the founding nations of the Group of Six (G6). In 1973, West
                                Germany—home to roughly 1.26% of the world's population—featured the world's fourth
                                largest
                                GDP
                                of 944 billion (5.9% of the world total). In 1987 the FRG held a 7.4% share of total
                                world
                                production.</p>

                            <h2 id="wch03">Position towards East Germany</h2>
                            <p>The official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the
                                West
                                German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only
                                legitimate,
                                representative of the German people. According to the Hallstein Doctrine, any country
                                (with
                                the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the German Democratic
                                Republic
                                would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.</p>

                            <p>In the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of "Neue Ostpolitik" led to a form of mutual
                                recognition between East and West Germany. The Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the
                                Treaty of
                                Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit
                                Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972) helped to normalise relations
                                between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the United Nations.
                                The
                                Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an exclusive
                                mandate
                                for Germany as a whole.</p>

                            <p>Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a de facto
                                government within a single German nation and a de jure state organisation of parts of
                                Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it
                                could not within its own structures recognise the GDR de jure as a sovereign state under
                                international law; while at the same time acknowledging that, within the structures of
                                international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West
                                Germany
                                then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the de facto and de jure
                                government, but also the sole de jure legitimate representative of a dormant "Germany as
                                whole".[148] The two Germanies relinquished any claim to represent the other
                                internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of
                                each other as both capable of representing their own populations de jure in
                                participating in
                                international bodies and agreements, such as the United Nations and the Helsinki Final
                                Act.
                            </p>

                            <p>"... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such
                                a
                                subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in
                                international
                                law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such
                                recognition
                                has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on
                                the
                                contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of
                                Germany
                                towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its détente policy,
                                in
                                particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be
                                understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty
                                is
                                that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of
                                international
                                law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is
                                between
                                two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being
                                reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body
                                politic."[150]
                                The West German Constitution (Grundgesetz, "Basic Law") provided two articles for the
                                unification with other parts of Germany:</p>

                            <p>Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal
                                Republic
                                (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).<br>
                                Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new
                                constitution.<br>
                                After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23
                                August 1990 declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article
                                23
                                of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on
                                3
                                October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific
                                terms
                                and conditions; including fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law) was
                                achieved
                                constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through
                                a
                                binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each
                                another as separate sovereign states in international law.[151] This treaty was then
                                voted
                                into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the Bundestag by the
                                constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the
                                extinction
                                of the GDR and the re-establishment of Länder on the territory of East Germany; and on
                                the
                                other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Amongst these
                                amendments was the repeal of the very Article 23 in respect of which the GDR had
                                nominally
                                declared its postdated accession to the Federal Republic.</p>

                            <p>The two German states entered into a currency and customs union in July 1990, and on 3
                                October 1990, the German Democratic Republic dissolved and the re-established five East
                                German Länder (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany,
                                bringing
                                an end to the East–West divide.</p>

                            <p>Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The Adenauer era
                                (1949–63)
                                was
                                followed by a brief period under Ludwig Erhard (1963–66) who, in turn, was replaced by
                                Kurt
                                Georg Kiesinger (1966–69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the
                                united
                                caucus of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), either
                                alone or
                                in coalition with the smaller Free Democratic Party (FDP) or other right-wing parties.

                            <p>The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, the
                                Villa
                                Hammerschmidt
                                Kiesinger's 1966–69 "Grand Coalition" was between West Germany's two largest parties,
                                the
                                CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). This was important for the introduction
                                of
                                new
                                emergency acts—the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of
                                votes
                                required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights
                                such
                                as
                                freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency.</p>

                            <p>Leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by
                                the
                                FDP, the rising German student movement, a group calling itself Notstand der Demokratie
                                ("Democracy in a State of Emergency") and the labour unions. Demonstrations and protests
                                grew in
                                number, and in 1967 the student Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head by a policeman. The
                                press,
                                especially the tabloid Bild-Zeitung newspaper, launched a campaign against the
                                protesters.
                            </p>

                            <p>By 1968 a stronger desire to confront the Nazi past had come into being. In the 1970s
                                environmentalism and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans.
                                As
                                a
                                result, in 1979 the Greens were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain
                                parliamentary
                                seats in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen state election, and with the foundation of
                                the
                                national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green
                                movements
                                in
                                the world.</p>

                            <p>Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the Red Army Faction (RAF).
                                The
                                RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany
                                during
                                the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name RAF. The
                                last
                                action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.

                            <p>Helmut Kohl in 1987
                                In the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with
                                the
                                FDP.
                                SPD leader and Chancellor Willy Brandt remained head of government until May 1974, when
                                he
                                resigned after the Guillaume Affair, in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered
                                as
                                a
                                spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi. However the affair is widely
                                considered
                                to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause.
                                Instead,
                                Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression[152][153] as well as the
                                economic
                                fallout of the 1973 oil crisis, almost seems simply to have had enough. As Brandt
                                himself
                                later
                                said, "I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at
                                the
                                time".[154]</p>

                            <p>Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD–FDP
                                coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading
                                FDP
                                official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong
                                supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his
                                commitment to
                                "the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA".</p>

                            <p>The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 1
                                October
                                1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl as
                                Chancellor
                                in a
                                constructive vote of no confidence. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl
                                emerged
                                in
                                firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an
                                absolute
                                majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of
                                the
                                vote.</p>

                            <p>In January 1987 the Kohl–Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the
                                Greens
                                gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not
                                only
                                were
                                the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far
                                from a
                                majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.</p>

                            <h3>Denazification</h3>
                            <p>In 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. As a result, many people
                                with a
                                former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of West Germany. West German
                                President Walter Scheel and Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger were both former members of
                                the
                                Nazi
                                Party. In 1957, 77% of the West German Ministry of Justice's senior officials were
                                former
                                Nazi
                                Party members.[155] Konrad Adenauer's State Secretary Hans Globke had played a major
                                role in
                                drafting anti-semitic Nuremberg Race Laws in Nazi Germany.[156]</p>

                            <p>In many aspects, German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime. Old
                                and
                                new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in
                                the
                                1920s, grew.</p>
                            <h3>Sport</h3>
                            <p>In the 20th century, association football became the largest sport in Germany. The
                                Germany
                                national football team, established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the
                                Federal
                                Republic of Germany, winning the 1954 FIFA World Cup in a stunning upset dubbed the
                                miracle
                                of Bern. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The
                                1974
                                FIFA World Cup was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten
                                by
                                their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the German Football
                                Association won the cup again, defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final. With the
                                process
                                of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup,
                                with
                                players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European
                                championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996.</p>
                            <p>After both Olympic Games of 1936 had been held in Germany, Munich was selected to host
                                the
                                1972 Summer Olympics. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans
                                showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, Germany at the
                                Olympics had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials
                                as
                                the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team</p>
                            <p>The 800-page "Doping in Germany from 1950 to today" study details how the West German
                                government helped fund a wide-scale doping programme.[157][158] West Germany encouraged
                                and
                                covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades.</p>
                            <p>As in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in
                                late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts.
                                Thus,
                                the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are
                                identical
                                to those that had been informally called "West German" before 1991. The only differences
                                were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These
                                organisations
                                and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany
                                before
                                the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old
                                continuity
                                despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and
                                organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four
                                decades, yet quite successful in that time.</p>
                            <h3>Literary Scene</h3>
                            <p>Besides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the
                                background of the experiences of war and after war period. Wolfgang Borchert, a former
                                soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representatives of the
                                Trümmerliteratur. Heinrich Böll is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic
                                from
                                the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his
                                increasingly
                                critical view on society.[citation needed] The Frankfurt Book Fair (and its Peace Prize
                                of
                                the German Book Trade) soon developed into a regarded institution. Exemplary for West
                                Germany's literature are – among others – Siegfried Lenz (with The German Lesson) and
                                Günter
                                Grass (with The Tin Drum and The Flounder).</p>

                            <p>East Germany, officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR; German: Deutsche
                                Demokratische
                                Republik, pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃə demoˈkʁaːtɪʃə ʁepuˈbliːk] (About this soundlisten), DDR,
                                pronounced [ˌdeːdeːˈʔɛʁ] (About this soundlisten)), was a country that existed from 1949
                                to
                                1990, the period when the eastern portion of Germany was part of the Eastern Bloc during
                                the
                                Cold War. Commonly described as a communist state in English usage, it described itself
                                as a
                                socialist "workers' and peasants' state".[7] It consisted of territory that was
                                administered
                                and
                                occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II—the Soviet occupation zone
                                of
                                the
                                Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the Oder–Neisse line. The Soviet zone
                                surrounded

                            <p>The GDR was established in the Soviet zone while the Federal Republic of Germany,
                                commonly
                                referred to as West Germany, was established in the three western zones. A satellite
                                state
                                of
                                the Soviet Union,[8] Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative
                                responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 and the GDR began to function as a
                                state
                                on 7
                                October 1949. However, Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War.
                                Until
                                1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), although other

                                nominally participated in its alliance organization, the National Front of the German
                                Democratic
                                Republic.[9] The SED made the teaching of Marxism–Leninism and the Russian language
                                compulsory
                                in schools.[10]</p>

                            <p>The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned.[11] Prices of housing,
                                basic
                                goods and services were heavily subsidized and set by central government planners rather
                                than
                                rising and falling through supply and demand. Although the GDR had to pay substantial
                                war
                                reparations to the Soviets, it became the most successful economy in the Eastern Bloc.
                                Emigration to the West was a significant problem as many of the emigrants were
                                well-educated
                                young people and weakened the state economically. The government fortified its western
                                borders
                                and built the Berlin Wall in 1961.[12] Many people attempting to flee[13][14] were
                                killed by
                                border guards or booby traps such as landmines.[15] Those captured spent large amounts
                                of
                                time
                                imprisoned for attempting to escape.[16][17]</p>

                            <p>In 1989, numerous social, economic and political forces in the GDR and abroad, one of the
                                most
                                notable ones being the peaceful protests starting in the city of Leipzig, led to the
                                fall of
                                the
                                Berlin Wall and the establishment of a government committed to liberalization. The
                                following
                                year, a free and fair election was held[18] and international negotiations led to the
                                signing of
                                the Final Settlement treaty on the status and borders of Germany. The GDR dissolved
                                itself
                                and
                                reunified with West Germany on 3 October 1990, becoming a fully sovereign state in the
                                reunified
                                Federal Republic of Germany. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist
                                leader
                                Egon Krenz, were prosecuted by the Federal Republic after reunification for offenses
                                committed
                                during the Cold War.[19][20]</p>

                            <p>Geographically, the GDR bordered the Baltic Sea to the north, Poland to the east,
                                Czechoslovakia
                                to the southeast and West Germany to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR also
                                bordered
                                the Soviet sector of Allied-occupied Berlin, known as East Berlin, which was also
                                administered
                                as the state's de facto capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the
                                United
                                States, United Kingdom and France known collectively as West Berlin. The three sectors

                            <p>There were four periods in East German political history.[72] These included: 1949–61,
                                which
                                saw the building of socialism; 1961–1970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a
                                period of stability and consolidation; 1971–85 was termed the Honecker Era, and saw
                                closer
                                ties with West Germany; and 1985–90 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.</p>
                            <h3>Organisation</h3>
                            <p>The ruling political party in East Germany was the Sozialistische Einheitspartei
                                Deutschlands
                                (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED). It was created in 1946 through the
                                Soviet-directed
                                merger of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of
                                Germany
                                (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a
                                full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed
                                out.[55]</p>
                            <p>The member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED, and had to accept its
                                "leading role" as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have
                                representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.</p>
                            <p>The Volkskammer also included representatives from the mass organisations like the Free
                                German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend or FDJ), or the Free German Trade Union Federation.
                                There was also a Democratic Women's Federation of Germany, with seats in the
                                Volkskammer.
                            </p>
                            <p>Important non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German
                                Gymnastics and Sports Association (Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund or DTSB), and People's
                                Solidarity (Volkssolidarität), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note
                                was
                                the Society for German-Soviet Friendship.</p>
                            <p>After the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the "Party of Democratic Socialism"
                                (PDS)
                                which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German
                                WASG to
                                form the Left Party (Die Linke). The Left Party continues to be a political force in
                                many
                                parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.</p>

                            <p>Until 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, East Berlin (though legally it was not
                                fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
                                (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Saxony, their
                                post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the
                                Middle German Länder (states) and Provinzen (provinces of Prussia). The western parts of
                                two provinces, Pomerania and Lower Silesia, the remainder of which were annexed by
                                Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.
                            </p>

                            <p>The East German Administrative Reform of 1952 established 14 Bezirke (districts) and de
                                facto disestablished the five Länder. The new Bezirke, named after their district
                                centres, were as follows: (i) Rostock, (ii) Neubrandenburg, and (iii) Schwerin created
                                from the Land (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) Potsdam, (v) Frankfurt (Oder), and (vii)
                                Cottbus from Brandenburg; (vi) Magdeburg and (viii) Halle from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix)
                                Leipzig, (xi) Dresden, and (xii) Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from
                                1990) from Saxony; and (x) Erfurt, (xiii) Gera, and (xiv) Suhl from Thuringia.</p>

                            <p>East Berlin was made the country's 15th Bezirk in 1961 but retained special legal status
                                until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city
                                as a whole being legally under the control of the Allied Control Council, and diplomatic
                                objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the Bezirk of Berlin as part
                                of its territory.</p>

                            <p>The government of East Germany had control over a large number of military and
                                paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the
                                Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the
                                Cold War (1945–92), its military forces were among the most advanced of the Warsaw Pact.
                                Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute</p>
                            <h3>National People's Army</h3>
                            <p>The Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It
                                was formed in 1956 from the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (Barracked People's Police), the
                                military units of the regular police (Volkspolizei), when East Germany joined the Warsaw
                                Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the Ministry of National Defence (East
                                Germany). It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month conscription period was
                                introduced in 1962.[citation needed] It was regarded by NATO officers as the best
                                military in the Warsaw Pact.</p>
                            <h3>Border troops</h3>
                            <p>The border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the
                                Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the Bundesgrenzschutz in West Germany. It was
                                controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East
                                Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in
                                1961, modeled after the Soviet Border Troops, and transferred to the Ministry of
                                National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from
                                the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately
                                47,000 men.</p>

                            <h3>Support of Third World socialist countries</h3>
                            <p>After receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972–73, the GDR began
                                active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and national liberation
                                movements. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces
                                were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the People's Republic of Angola and
                                socialist Ethiopia), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and
                                personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own
                                Stasi model.</p>
                            <p>Already in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's MPLA, Mozambique's FRELIMO
                                and the PAIGC in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was
                                established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics:
                                People's Republic of the Congo, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Somali Democratic
                                Republic, Libya, and the People's Republic of Benin.</p>
                            <p>The first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo.
                                In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>It was estimated that altogether, 2000–4000 DDR military and security experts were
                                dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and
                                liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.</p>
                            <h3>East Germany and the Middle East conflict</h3>
                            <p>East Germany pursued an anti-Zionist policy; Jeffrey Herf argues that East Germany was
                                waging an undeclared war on Israel.[86] According to Herf, "the Middle East was one of
                                the crucial battlefields of the global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West;
                                it was also a region in which East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc's
                                antagonism toward Israel."[87] While East Germany saw itself as an "anti-fascist state",
                                it regarded Israel as a "fascist state"[88] and East Germany strongly supported the
                                Palestine Liberation Organization in its armed struggle against Israel. In 1974, the GDR
                                government recognized the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
                                people".[89] The PLO declared the Palestinian state on 15 November 1988 during the First
                                Intifada and the GDR recognized the state prior to reunification.[90] After becoming a
                                member of the UN, East Germany "made excellent use of the UN to wage political warfare
                                against Israel [and was] an enthusiastic, high-profile, and vigorous member" of the
                                anti-Israeli majority of the General Assembly.</p>

                            <p>The East German economy began poorly because of the devastation caused by the Second
                                World War; the loss of so many young soldiers, the disruption of business and
                                transportation, the allied bombing campaigns that decimated cities, and reparations owed
                                to the USSR. The Red Army dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and
                                industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations
                                were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and Lower Silesia, with its coal
                                mines and Szczecin, an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of
                                Stalin and in accordance with Potsdam Agreement.</p>
                            <p>The socialist centrally planned economy of the German Democratic Republic was like that
                                of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the COMECON trade bloc. In 1985, collective (state)
                                enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods
                                and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita
                                income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars) (this is based on unreal official exchange
                                rate). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent.
                                This made the East German economy the richest in all of the Soviet Bloc until
                                reunification in 1990.</p>
                            <p>Notable East German exports were photographic cameras, under the Praktica brand;
                                automobiles under the Trabant, Wartburg, and the IFA brands; hunting rifles, sextants,
                                typewriters and wristwatches.</p>
                            <p>Until the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of basic foodstuffs such as sugar and
                                coffee. East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a hard
                                currency) and the necessary Staatsbank foreign currency account could afford Western
                                products and export-quality East German products via Intershop. Consumer goods also were
                                available, by post, from the Danish Jauerfood, and Genex companies.</p>
                            <p>The government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised
                                prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as "the second
                                pay packet".[92] At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of
                                semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR
                                money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more
                                dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East
                                Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the
                                Deutsche Mark (DM).[93] Economic issues would also persist in the east of Germany after
                                the reunification of the west and the east, James Hawes in his book 'the shortest
                                history of Germany'. Quotes from the federal office of political education (23 June
                                2009) 'In 1991 alone, 153 billion Deutschmarks had to be transferred to eastern Germany
                                to secure incomes, support businesses and improve infrastructure... by 1999 the total
                                had amounted to 1.634 trillion Marks net... The sums were so large that public debt in
                                Germany more than doubled.'</p>
                            <h3></h3>
                            <p>Many western commentators have maintained that loyalty to the SED was a primary criterion
                                for getting a good job, and that professionalism was secondary to political criteria in
                                personnel recruitment and development.</p>
                            <p>Beginning in 1963 with a series of secret international agreements, East Germany
                                recruited workers from Poland, Hungary, Cuba, Albania, Mozambique, Angola and North
                                Vietnam. They numbered more than 100,000 by 1989. Many, such as future politician Zeca
                                Schall (who emigrated from Angola in 1988 as a contract worker) stayed in Germany after
                                the Wende.</p>

                                <p>The ruling communist party, known as the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED),
                                    formed in April 1946 from the merger between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD)
                                    and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).[33] The two former parties were
                                    notorious rivals when they were active before the Nazis consolidated all power and
                                    criminalised them, and official East German and Soviet histories portrayed this
                                    merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties and symbolic of
                                    the new friendship of German socialists after defeating their common enemy; however,
                                    there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than commonly portrayed,
                                    and that the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD's
                                    eastern branch to merge with the KPD, and the communists, who held a majority, had
                                    virtually total control over policy.[34] The SED remained the ruling party for the
                                    entire duration of the East German state. It had close ties with the Soviets, which
                                    maintained military forces in East Germany until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991
                                    (the Russian Federation continued to maintain forces in the territory of the former
                                    East Germany until 1994), with the stated purpose of countering NATO bases in West
                                    Germany.</p>

                                <p>On 4–11 February 1945 leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the
                                    Soviet
                                    Union held the Yalta Conference where future arrangements regarding post-war Europe
                                    and
                                    Allied strategy against Japan in the Pacific were negotiated. They agreed that the
                                    boundaries of Germany as at 31 December 1937 would be chosen as demarcating German
                                    national territory from German occupied territory; all German annexations after 1937
                                    were automatically null. Subsequently, and into the 1970s, the West German state was
                                    to
                                    maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be 'valid in international law';
                                    although the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that East Prussia and
                                    Silesia
                                    must be transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union in any Peace agreement. The
                                    conference agreed that post-war Germany, minus these transfers, would be divided
                                    into
                                    four occupation zones: a French Zone in the far west; a British Zone in the
                                    northwest;
                                    an American Zone in the south; and a Soviet Zone in the East. Berlin was separately
                                    divided into four zones. These divisions were not intended to dismember Germany,
                                    only to
                                    designate zones of administration.</p>

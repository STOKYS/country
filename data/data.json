The region stretched roughly from the Middle and Lower Rhine in the west to the Vistula in the east. It also extended as far south as the Upper and Middle Danube and Pannonia, and to the known parts of Scandinavia in the north. Archaeologically, these peoples correspond roughly to the Roman Iron Age of those regions. While apparently dominated by Germanic peoples, Magna Germania was inhabited by non-Germanic peoples as well, including Celts and Early Slavs and their precursors.</p>\n                  <p>The Latin name Germania means \"land of the Germani\", but the etymology of the name Germani itself is uncertain. During the Gallic Wars of the 1st century BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar encountered peoples originating from beyond the Rhine. He referred to these people as Germani and their lands beyond the Rhine as Germania. In subsequent years, the Roman emperor Augustus sought to expand across the Rhine towards the Elbe, but these efforts were hampered by the victory of Arminius at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. The prosperous provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior, sometimes collectively referred to as Roman Germania, were subsequently established in northeast Roman Gaul, while territories beyond the Rhine remained independent of Roman control.</p>\n                  <p>From the 3rd century AD, Germanic peoples moving out of Magna Germania began encroaching upon and occupying parts of Roman Germania. This contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, after which territories of Roman Germania were captured and settled by migrating Germanic peoples. Large parts of Germania subsequently became part of the Frankish Empire and the later Kingdom of Germany. The name of Germany in English and many other languages is derived from the name Germania.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Etymology</h3>\n                    <p>In Latin, the name Germania means \"lands where people called Germani live\".[3] Modern scholars do not agree on the etymology of the name Germani. Celtic, Germanic, Illyrian and Latin etymologies have been suggested.</p>\n                    <p>The main source on the origin of the names Germania and Germani is the book Germania (98 AD) by Tacitus.[2] Tacitus writes that the name Germania was \"modern and newly introduced\". According to Tacitus, the name Germani had once been applied only to the Tungri, west of the Rhine, but became an \"artificial name\" (invento nomine) for supposedly related peoples east of the Rhine.[1][2] Many modern scholars consider Tacitus' story plausible, although it is doubted whether the name was commonly used by Germani to refer to themselves.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>Geography</h3>\n                    <p>The boundaries of Germania are not clearly defined, particularly at its northern and eastern fringes.[6] Magna Germania stretched approximately from the Rhine in the west to beyond the Vistula river in the east, and from the Danube in the south and northwards along the North and Baltic seas, including Scandinavia.[7][8][9][10] Germania Superior encompassed parts of modern-day Switzerland, southwest Germany and eastern France, while Germania Inferior encompassed much of modern-day Belgium and Netherlands.</p>\n                    <p>In his Geography (150 AD), the Roman geographer Ptolemy provides descriptions of the geography of Germania.[11] Modern scholars have been able to localize many of the place names mentioned by Ptolemy, and associated them with place names of the present day.</p>\n                    <p>Germania was inhabited by a large number of peoples, and there was not much unity among them.[13] It appears that Germania was not entirely inhabited by Germanic peoples. Hydronymy provides evidence for the presence of another Indo-European group, which probably lived under Germanic domination.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec04\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <p>During the Gallic Wars of the 1st century BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar came into contact with peoples originating east of the Rhine. In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar refers to these peoples as the Germani, and the lands from where they originated as Germania.[11] The Romans appear to have borrowed the name from the Gauls.[15] Having defeated the Germanic chieftain Ariovistus in Gaul, Caesar built bridges across the Rhine and conducted punitive expeditions in Germania.[16] He writes the area was composed of numerous Germanic states, which were not entirely united.[17][18] According to Caesar, the Gallic Volcae Tectosages had once crossed the Rhine and colonized parts of Germania, but had since become militarily inferior to the Germani.[19] He also writes that Germani had once crossed the Rhine into northeast Gaul and driven away its Gallic inhabitants, and that the Belgae claimed to be largely descended from these Germanic invaders.</p>\n                    <p>In the late 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, the Roman emperor Augustus launched campaigns across the Rhine, and sought to incorporate areas of Germania as far east as the Elbe into the Roman Empire. He planned to turn this area into the proposed province of Magna Germania, with headquarters at Colonia (modern-day Cologne, Germany). The Roman campaign was severely hampered by the victory of Arminius at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD.[11] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania, and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[22] The Rhine eventually became the border between the Roman Empire and Magna Germania. Areas of northeast Gaul bordering the Rhine remained under Roman control, and are often referred to as Roman Germania. Four Roman legions were stationed there, and a Roman fleet, the Classis Germanica, was also established. The area was effectively governed as Roman provinces.</p>\n                    <p>Areas of Germania independent of Roman control were referred to as Magna Germania.[11] Modern scholars sometimes refer to the Magna Germania as Free Germania (Latin: Germania Libera) or Germanic Barbaricum.[23] As parts of Roman social engineering efforts, large numbers of Germani, including Ubii and Sicambri, were settled within Roman Germania in order to prevent revolts by resident Gauls. Roman Germania became characterized by a mixed Celtic, Germanic and Roman population, which became progressively Romanized.</p>\n                    <p>By the mid 1st century AD, between eight and ten Roman legions were stationed in Roman Germania to protect the frontiers. Many of the soldiers of these Roman legions were Germanic. In 69-70 AD, Roman Germania was heavily affected by the Revolt of the Batavi.[11] Tacitus writes that the leader of the revolt, Gaius Julius Civilis, recruited a vast amount of warriors from his self-described \"kinsmen\" all over Germania, and hailed Arminius for having liberated Germania from slavery.[24][25][26] Civilis' rebels seized Colonia, capital of Roman Germania and home of the Germanic Ubii, who according to Tacitus were considered traitors by other Germani for having \"forsworn its native country\".[26][27] After initially seeking to raze all of Colonia to the ground, the forces of Civilis declared the city returned \"into the unity of the German nation and name\" and \"an open city for all Germans\".[28][27] Although initially declaring the rebels and \"other Germans\" their \"kinsmen by blood\", the Ubii eventually assisted the Romans in recapturing the Colonia.</p>\n                    <p>In the late 1st century AD, under the leadership of the Flavian dynasty, the provinces of Germania Inferior (headquartered at Colonia) and Germania Superior (headquartered at Mogontiacum) were created out of Roman Germania and other eastern parts of Roman Gaul. They hosted a large military force and carried out lucrative trade with Magna Germania, which greatly contributed to the wealth of Roman Gaul.[29][6] Germania (98 AD) by Tacitus provided vivid descriptions of the peoples of Magna Germania.</p>\n                    <p>In the late 1st and early 2nd century AD, the Romans reoccupied areas lying between the Rhine, Main and Danube rivers. This area became known as the Agri Decumates.[6] Additional numbers of Germani were settled by the Romans within this area.[11] The Roman fortifications on the border with Magna Germania were known as the Limes Germanicus. The 3rd century AD saw the emergence of several powerful Germanic confederations in Magna Germania, such as the Alemanni and Franks.[11] The Crisis of the Third Century included raids on Roman Germania by Alemanni and Franks, and the area briefly became part of the Gallic Empire established by the usurper Postumus.[11] Around 280 AD, the Agri Decumates were evacuated by the Romans and occupied by Alemanni.</p>\n                    <p>Under Diocletian (3rd century AD), Germania Superior was renamed Germania Secunda, while Germania Inferior was renamed Maxima Sequanorum. Both provinces were under the Diocese of Gaul. The provinces of Roman Germania continued to be subjected to repeated Alemannic and Frankish attacks.[29] In the late 4th century AD and early 5th century AD, Gothic Wars in the Balkans forced the Romans to withdraw troops from Roman Germania. In 406, a large number of people fleeing the Huns crossed the Rhine from Magna Germania into Roman Germania and Gaul, leading to the eventually collapse of Roman rule there, and the emigration of large numbers of Romans, particularly Roman elites. Roman Germania was subsequently occupied by Alemanni and Franks.[11] During subsequent centuries, peoples of Germania played a major role in dismembering what was left of the Western Roman Empire.[6] Large parts of Germania, including all of Roman Germania, were eventually incorporated into the Frankish Empire.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec05\">\n                    <h3>Archaeology</h3>\n                    <p>From the 1st to the 4th century AD, Magna Germania corresponds archaeologically to the Roman Iron Age.[30] In recent years, progress in archaeology has contributed greatly to the understanding of Germania. Areas of Magna Germania were largely agrarian, and display archaeological commonalities with each other, while being strongly differentiated from that of Roman Germania, largely due to the absence of cities and independent coinage.[31] Archaeological discoveries testify to flourishing trade between Magna Germania and the Roman Empire. Amber was a primary export out of Magna Germania, while Roman luxury goods were imported on a large scale. Such goods have been found as far as Scandinavia and Western Russia.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec06\">\n                    <h3>Legacy</h3>\n                    <p>The name Germania is attested in Old English translations of Bede and Orosius.

It was ruled by the\n                        Franks during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, West\n                        Francia became the predecessor of France, and East Francia became that of Germany. Francia was\n                        among the last surviving Germanic kingdoms from the Migration Period era before its partition in\n                        843.</p>\n                    <p>The core Frankish territories inside the former Western Roman Empire were close to the Rhine and\n                        Maas rivers in the north. After a period where small kingdoms inter-acted with the remaining\n                        Gallo-Roman institutions to their south, a single kingdom uniting them was founded by Clovis I\n                        who was crowned King of the Franks in 496. His dynasty, the Merovingian dynasty, was eventually\n                        replaced by the Carolingian dynasty. Under the nearly continuous campaigns of Pepin of Herstal,\n                        Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, Charlemagne, and Louis the Pious—father, son, grandson,\n                        great-grandson and great-great-grandson—the greatest expansion of the Frankish empire was\n                        secured by the early 9th century, by this point dubbed as the Carolingian Empire.</p>\n                    <p>During the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties the Frankish realm was one large kingdom polity\n                        subdivided into several smaller kingdoms, often effectively independent. The geography and\n                        number of subkingdoms varied over time, but a basic split between eastern and western domains\n                        persisted. The eastern kingdom was initially called Austrasia, centred on the Rhine and Meuse,\n                        and expanding eastwards into central Europe. It evolved into a German kingdom, the Holy Roman\n                        Empire. The western kingdom Neustria was founded in Northern Roman Gaul, and as the original\n                        kingdom of the Merovingians it came over time to be referred to as Francia, now France, although\n                        in other contexts western Europe generally could still be described as \"Frankish\". In Germany\n                        there are prominent other places named after the Franks such as the region of Franconia, the\n                        city of Frankfurt, and Frankenstein Castle.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Life in Francia</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Law</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Church</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Society</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Currency</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Law</h4>\n                        <p>The different Frankish tribes, such as the Salii, Ripuarii, and Chamavi, had different legal\n                            traditions, which were only lately codified, largely under Charlemagne. The Leges Salica,\n                            Ribuaria, and Chamavorum were Carolingian creations, their basis in earlier Frankish reality\n                            being difficult for scholars to discern at the present distance. Under Charlemagne\n                            codifications\n                            were also made of the Saxon law and the Frisian law.</p>\n                        <p>It was also under Frankish hegemony that the other Germanic societies east of the Rhine began\n                            to\n                            codify their tribal law, in such compilations as the Lex Alamannorum and Lex Bajuvariorum\n                            for\n                            the Alemanni and Bavarii respectively.

The Merovingians adopted the capitulary as a tool for the\n                            promulgation and preservation of royal ordinances. Its usage was to continue under the\n                            Carolingians and even the later Spoletan emperors Guy and Lambert under a programme of\n                            renovation regni Francorum (\"renewal of the Frankish kingdom\").</p>\n                        <p>The last Merovingian capitulary was one of the most significant: the edict of Paris, issued\n                            by\n                            Chlothar II in 614 in the presence of his magnates, had been likened to a Frankish Magna\n                            Carta\n                            entrenching the rights of the nobility, but in actuality it sought to remove corruption from\n                            the\n                            judiciary and protect local and regional interests.

Childebert III\n                            even\n                            found cases against the powerful Arnulfings and became renowned among the people for his\n                            justness. But law in Francia was to experience a renaissance under the Carolingians.</p>\n                        <p>Among the legal reforms adopted by Charlemagne were the codifications of traditional law\n                            mentioned above. He also sought to place checks on the power of local and regional\n                            judiciaries\n                            by the method of appointing missi dominici in pairs to oversee specific regions for short\n                            periods of time.

He arrived on the continent with twelve companions and founded Annegray, Luxeuil, and\n                            Fontaines in France and Bobbio in Italy. During the 7th century the disciples of Columbanus\n                            and\n                            other Scottish and Irish missionaries founded several monasteries or Schottenklöster in what\n                            are\n                            now France, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland.

While all of them had a tradition of participating in the Roman\n                            military, the Salians were allowed to settle within the Roman Empire. In 358, having already\n                            been living in the civitas of Batavia for some time, Emperor Julian, defeated the Chamavi and\n                            Salians, allowing the latter to settle further away from the border, in Toxandria.</p>\n                        <p>Some of the early Frankish leaders, such as Flavius Bauto and Arbogast, were committed to the\n                            cause of the Romans, but other Frankish rulers, such as Mallobaudes, were active on Roman soil\n                            for other reasons. After the fall of Arbogastes, his son Arigius succeeded in establishing a\n                            hereditary countship at Trier and after the fall of the usurper Constantine III some Franks\n                            supported the usurper Jovinus (411). Jovinus was dead by 413, but the Romans found it\n                            increasingly difficult to manage the Franks within their borders.</p>\n                        <p>The Frankish king Theudemer was executed by the sword, in c. 422.</p>\n                        <p>Around 428, the king Chlodio, whose kingdom may have been in the civitas Tungrorum (with its\n                            capital in Tongeren), launched an attack on Roman territory and extended his realm as far as\n                            Camaracum (Cambrai) and the Somme. Though Sidonius Apollinaris relates that Flavius Aetius\n                            defeated a wedding party of his people (c. 431), this period marks the beginning of a situation\n                            that would endure for many centuries: the Germanic Franks ruled over an increasing number of\n                            Gallo-Roman subjects.</p>\n                        <p>The Merovingians, reputed to be relatives of Chlodio, arose from within the Gallo-Roman military,\n                            with Childeric and his son Clovis being called \"King of the Franks\" in the Gallo-Roman military,\n                            even before having any Frankish territorial kingdom. Once Clovis defeated his Roman competitor\n                            for power in northern Gaul, Syagrius, he turned to the kings of the Franks to the north and\n                            east, as well as other post-Roman kingdoms already existing in Gaul: Visigoths, Burgundians, and\n                            Alemanni.</p>\n                        <p>The original core territory of the Frankish kingdom later came to be known as Austrasia (the\n                            \"eastern lands\"), while the large Romanised Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul came to be known\n                            as Neustria.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Merovingian rise and decline, 481–687</h4>\n                        <p>Chlodio's successors are obscure figures, but what can be certain is that Childeric I, possibly\n                            his grandson, ruled a Salian kingdom from Tournai as a foederatus of the Romans. Childeric is\n                            chiefly important to history for bequeathing the Franks to his son Clovis, who began an effort\n                            to extend his authority over the other Frankish tribes and to expand their territorium south and\n                            west into Gaul. Clovis converted to Christianity and put himself on good terms with the powerful\n                            Church and with his Gallo-Roman subjects.</p>\n                        <p>In a thirty-year reign (481–511) Clovis defeated the Roman general Syagrius and conquered the\n                            Kingdom of Soissons, defeated the Alemanni (Battle of Tolbiac, 496) and established Frankish\n                            hegemony over them. Clovis defeated the Visigoths (Battle of Vouillé, 507) and conquered all of\n                            their territory north of the Pyrenees save Septimania, and conquered the Bretons (according to\n                            Gregory of Tours) and made them vassals of Francia. He conquered most or all of the neighbouring\n                            Frankish tribes along the Rhine and incorporated them into his kingdom.</p>\n                        <p>He also incorporated the various Roman military settlements (laeti) scattered over Gaul: the\n                            Saxons of Bessin, the Britons and the Alans of Armorica and Loire valley or the Taifals of\n                            Poitou to name a few prominent ones. By the end of his life, Clovis ruled all of Gaul save the\n                            Gothic province of Septimania and the Burgundian kingdom in the southeast.</p>\n                        <p>The Merovingians were a hereditary monarchy. The Frankish kings adhered to the practice of\n                            partible inheritance: dividing their lands among their sons. Even when multiple Merovingian\n                            kings ruled, the kingdom—not unlike the late Roman Empire—was conceived of as a single realm\n                            ruled collectively by several kings and the turn of events could result in the reunification of\n                            the whole realm under a single king. The Merovingian kings ruled by divine right and their\n                            kingship was symbolised daily by their long hair and initially by their acclamation, which was\n                            carried out by raising the king on a shield in accordance with the ancient Germanic practice of\n                            electing a war-leader at an assembly of the warriors.</p>\n                        <h5>Clovis's sons</h5>\n                        <p>At the death of Clovis, his kingdom was divided territorially by his four adult sons in such a\n                            way that each son was granted a comparable portion of fiscal land, which was probably land once\n                            part of the Roman fisc, now seized by the Frankish government.</p>\n                        <p>Clovis's sons made their capitals near the Frankish heartland in northeastern Gaul. Theuderic I\n                            made his capital at Reims, Chlodomer at Orléans, Childebert I at Paris, and Chlothar I at\n                            Soissons. During their reigns, the Thuringii (532), Burgundes (534), and Saxons and Frisians (c.\n                            560) were incorporated into the Frankish kingdom. The outlying trans-Rhenish tribes were loosely\n                            attached to Frankish sovereignty, and though they could be forced to contribute to Frankish\n                            military efforts, in times of weak kings they were uncontrollable and liable to attempt\n                            independence. The Romanised Burgundian kingdom, however, was preserved in its territoriality by\n                            the Franks and converted into one of their primary divisions, incorporating the central Gallic\n                            heartland of Chlodomer's realm with its capital at Orléans.</p>\n                        <p>The fraternal kings showed only intermittent signs of friendship and were often in rivalry. On\n                            the early death of Chlodomer, his brother Chlothar had his young sons murdered in order to take\n                            a share of his kingdom, which was, in accordance with custom, divided between the surviving\n                            brothers. Theuderic died in 534, but his adult son Theudebert I was capable of defending his\n                            inheritance, which formed the largest of the Frankish subkingdoms and the kernel of the later\n                            kingdom of Austrasia.</p>\n                        <p>Theudebert was the first Frankish king to formally sever his ties to the Byzantine Empire by\n                            striking gold coins with his own image on them and calling himself magnus rex (great king)\n                            because of his supposed suzerainty over peoples as far away as Pannonia. Theudebert interfered\n                            in the Gothic War on the side of the Gepids and Lombards against the Ostrogoths, receiving the\n                            provinces of Raetia, Noricum, and part of Veneto.</p>\n                        <h5>Chlothar</h5>\n                        <p>His son and successor, Theudebald, was unable to retain them and on his death all of his vast\n                            kingdom passed to Chlothar, under whom, with the death of Childebert in 558, the entire Frankish\n                            realm was reunited under the rule of one king.</p>\n                        <p>In 561 Chlothar died and his realm was divided, in a replay of the events of fifty years prior,\n                            between his four sons, with the chief cities remaining the same. The eldest son, Charibert I,\n                            inherited the kingdom with its capital at Paris and ruled all of western Gaul. The second\n                            eldest, Guntram, inherited the old kingdom of the Burgundians, augmented by the lands of central\n                            France around the old capital of Orléans, which became his chief city, and most of Provence.</p>\n                        <p>The rest of Provence, the Auvergne, and eastern Aquitaine were assigned to the third son,\n                            Sigebert I, who also inherited Austrasia with its chief cities of Reims and Metz. The smallest\n                            kingdom was that of Soissons, which went to the youngest son, Chilperic I. The kingdom Chilperic\n                            ruled at his death (584) became the nucleus of later Neustria.</p>\n                        <p>This second fourfold division was quickly ruined by fratricidal wars, waged largely over the\n                            murder of Galswintha, the wife of Chilperic, allegedly by his mistress (and second wife)\n                            Fredegund. Galswintha's sister, the wife of Sigebert, Brunhilda, incited her husband to war and\n                            the conflict between the two queens continued to plague relations until the next century.\n                            Guntram sought to keep the peace, though he also attempted twice (585 and 589) to conquer\n                            Septimania from the Goths, but was defeated both times.</p>\n                        <p>All the surviving brothers benefited at the death of Charibert, but Chilperic was also able to\n                            extend his authority during the period of war by bringing the Bretons to heel again. After his\n                            death, Guntram had to again force the Bretons to submit. In 587, the Treaty of Andelot—the text\n                            of which explicitly refers to the entire Frankish realm as Francia—between Brunhilda and Guntram\n                            secured his protection of her young son Childebert II, who had succeeded the assassinated\n                            Sigebert (575). Together the territory of Guntram and Childebert was well over thrice as large\n                            as the small realm of Chilperic's successor, Chlothar II. During this period Francia took on the\n                            tripartite character it was to have throughout the rest of its history, being composed of\n                            Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy.</p>\n                        <h5>Francia split into Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy</h5>\n                        <p>When Guntram died in 592, Burgundy went to Childebert in its entirety, but he died in 595. His\n                            two sons divided the kingdom, with the elder Theudebert II taking Austrasia plus Childebert's\n                            portion of Aquitaine, while his younger brother Theuderic II inherited Burgundy and Guntram's\n                            Aquitaine. United, the brothers sought to remove their father's cousin Chlothar II from power\n                            and they did succeed in conquering most of his kingdom, reducing him to only a few cities, but\n                            they failed to capture him.</p>\n                        <p>In 599 they routed his forces at Dormelles and seized the Dentelin, but they then fell foul of\n                            each other and the remainder of their time on the thrones was spent in infighting, often incited\n                            by their grandmother Brunhilda, who, angered over her expulsion from Theudebert's court,\n                            convinced Theuderic to unseat him and kill him. In 612 he did and the whole realm of his father\n                            Childebert was once again ruled by one man. This was short-lived, however, as he died on the eve\n                            of preparing an expedition against Chlothar in 613, leaving a young son named Sigebert II.</p>\n                        <p>During their reigns, Theudebert and Theuderic campaigned successfully in Gascony, where they had\n                            established the Duchy of Gascony and brought the Basques to submission (602). This original\n                            Gascon conquest included lands south of the Pyrenees, namely Biscay and Gipuzkoa, but these were\n                            lost to the Visigoths in 612.</p>\n                        <p>On the opposite end of his realm, the Alemanni had defeated Theuderic in a rebellion and the\n                            Franks were losing their hold on the trans-Rhenish tribes. In 610 Theudebert had extorted the\n                            Duchy of Alsace from Theuderic, beginning a long period of conflict over which kingdom was to\n                            have the region of Alsace, Burgundy or Austrasia, which was only terminated in the late seventh\n                            century.</p>\n                        <p>During the brief minority of Sigebert II, the office of the Mayor of the Palace, which had for\n                            sometime been visible in the kingdoms of the Franks, came to the fore in its internal politics,\n                            with a faction of nobles coalescing around the persons of Warnachar II, Rado, and Pepin of\n                            Landen, to give the kingdom over to Chlothar in order to remove Brunhilda, the young king's\n                            regent, from power. Warnachar was himself already the mayor of the palace of Austrasia, while\n                            Rado and Pepin were to find themselves rewarded with mayoral offices after Chlothar's coup\n                            succeeded and Brunhilda and the ten-year-old king were killed.</p>\n                        <h5>Rule of Chlothar II</h5>\n                        <p>Immediately after his victory, Chlothar II promulgated the Edict of Paris (614), which has\n                            generally been viewed as a concession to the nobility, though this view has come under recent\n                            criticism. The Edict primarily sought to guarantee justice and end corruption in government, but\n                            it also entrenched the regional differences between the three kingdoms of Francia and probably\n                            granted the nobles more control over judicial appointments.</p>\n                        <p>By 623 the Austrasians had begun to clamour for a king of their own, since Chlothar was so often\n                            absent from the kingdom and, because of his upbringing and previous rule in the Seine basin, was\n                            more or less an outsider there. Chlothar thus granted that his son Dagobert I would be their\n                            king and he was duly acclaimed by the Austrasian warriors in the traditional fashion.\n                            Nonetheless, though Dagobert exercised true authority in his realm, Chlothar maintained ultimate\n                            control over the whole Frankish kingdom.</p>\n                        <p>During the joint reign of Chlothar and Dagobert, who have been called \"the last ruling\n                            Merovingians\", the Saxons, who had been loosely attached to Francia since the late 550s,\n                            rebelled under Berthoald, Duke of Saxony, and were defeated and reincorporated into the kingdom\n                            by the joint action of father and son. When Chlothar died in 628, Dagobert, in accordance with\n                            his father's wishes, granted a subkingdom to his younger brother Charibert II. This subkingdom,\n                            commonly called Aquitaine, was a new creation.</p>\n                        <h5>Dagobert I</h5>\n                        <p>Dagobert, in his dealings with the Saxons, Alemans, and Thuringii, as well as the Slavs beyond\n                            the borders of Francia, upon whom he tried to force tribute but who instead defeated him under\n                            their king Samo at the Battle of Wogastisburg in 631, made all the far eastern peoples subject\n                            to the court of Neustria and not of Austrasia. This, first and foremost, incited the Austrasians\n                            to request a king of their own from the royal household.</p>\n                        <p>The subkingdom of Aquitaine corresponded to the southern half of the old Roman province of\n                            Aquitaine and its capital was at Toulouse. The other cities of his kingdom were Cahors, Agen,\n                            Périgueux, Bordeaux, and Saintes; the duchy of Vasconia was also part of his allotment.\n                            Charibert campaigned successfully against the Basques, but after his death they revolted again\n                            (632). At the same time the Bretons rose up against Frankish suzerainty. The Breton leader\n                            Judicael relented and made peace with the Franks and paid tribute after Dagobert threatened to\n                            lead an army against him (635). That same year Dagobert sent an army to subdue the Basques,\n                            which it did.</p>\n                        <p>Meanwhile, Dagobert had Charibert's infant successor Chilperic assassinated and reunited the\n                            entire Frankish realm again (632), though he was forced by the strong Austrasian aristocracy to\n                            grant his own son Sigebert III to them as a subking in 633. This act was precipitated largely by\n                            the Austrasians desire to be self-governing at a time when Neustrians dominated at the royal\n                            court. Chlothar had been the king at Paris for decades before becoming the king at Metz as well\n                            and the Merovingian monarchy was ever after him to be a Neustrian monarchy first and foremost.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>Indeed, it is in the 640s that \"Neustria\" first appears in writing, its late appearance relative\n                            to \"Austrasia\" probably due to the fact that Neustrians (who formed the bulk of the authors of\n                            the time) called their region simply \"Francia\". Burgundia too defined itself in opposition to\n                            Neustria at about this time. However, it was the Austrasians, who had been seen as a distinct\n                            people within the realm since the time of Gregory of Tours, who were to make the most strident\n                            moves for independence.</p>\n                        <p>The young Sigebert was dominated during his minority by the mayor, Grimoald the Elder, who\n                            convinced the childless king to adopt his own Merovingian-named son Childebert as his son and\n                            heir. After Dagobert's death in 639, the duke of Thuringia, Radulf, rebelled and tried to make\n                            himself king. He defeated Sigebert in what was a serious reversal for the ruling dynasty (640).\n                        </p>\n                        <p>The king lost the support of many magnates while on campaign and the weakness of the monarchic\n                            institutions by that time are evident in his inability to effectively make war without the\n                            support of the magnates; in fact, he could not even provide his own bodyguard without the loyal\n                            aid of Grimoald and Adalgisel.

He was dominated by his mother\n                            Nanthild and the mayor of the Neustrian palace, Erchinoald. Erchinoald's successor, Ebroin,\n                            dominated the kingdom for the next fifteen years of near-constant civil war. On his death (656),\n                            Sigbert's son was shipped off to Ireland, while Grimoald's son Childebert reigned in Austrasia.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>Ebroin eventually reunited the entire Frankish kingdom for Clovis's successor Chlothar III by\n                            killing Grimoald and removing Childebert in 661. However, the Austrasians demanded a king of\n                            their own again and Chlothar installed his younger brother Childeric II. During Chlothar's\n                            reign, the Franks had made an attack on northwestern Italy, but were driven off by Grimoald,\n                            King of the Lombards, near Rivoli.</p>\n                    </div>\n                   <div id=\"art07\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                    <h4>Dominance of the mayors of the palace, 687–751</h4>\n                    <p>In 673, Chlothar III died and some Neustrian and Burgundian magnates invited Childeric to become\n                        king of the whole realm, but he soon upset some Neustrian magnates and he was assassinated\n                        (675).</p>\n                    <p>The reign of Theuderic III was to prove the end of the Merovingian dynasty's power. Theuderic III\n                        succeeded his brother Chlothar III in Neustria in 673, but Childeric II of Austrasia displaced\n                        him soon thereafter—until he died in 675, and Theuderic III retook his throne. When Dagobert II\n                        died in 679, Theuderic received Austrasia as well and became king of the whole Frankish realm.\n                        Thoroughly Neustrian in outlook, he allied with his mayor Berchar and made war on the Austrasian\n                        who had installed Dagobert II, Sigebert III's son, in their kingdom (briefly in opposition to\n                        Clovis III).</p>\n                    <p>In 687 he was defeated by Pepin of Herstal, the Arnulfing mayor of Austrasia and the real power\n                        in that kingdom, at the Battle of Tertry and was forced to accept Pepin as sole mayor and dux et\n                        princeps Francorum: \"Duke and Prince of the Franks\", a title which signifies, to the author of\n                        the Liber Historiae Francorum, the beginning of Pepin's \"reign\". Thereafter the Merovingian\n                        monarchs showed only sporadically, in our surviving records, any activities of a non-symbolic\n                        and self-willed nature.</p>\n                    <p>During the period of confusion in the 670s and 680s, attempts had been made to re-assert Frankish\n                        suzerainty over the Frisians, but to no avail. In 689, however, Pepin launched a campaign of\n                        conquest in Western Frisia (Frisia Citerior) and defeated the Frisian king Radbod near Dorestad,\n                        an important trading centre. All the land between the Scheldt and the Vlie was incorporated into\n                        Francia.</p>\n                    <p>Then, circa 690, Pepin attacked central Frisia and took Utrecht. In 695 Pepin could even sponsor\n                        the foundation of the Archdiocese of Utrecht and the beginning of the conversion of the Frisians\n                        under Willibrord. However, Eastern Frisia (Frisia Ulterior) remained outside of Frankish\n                        suzerainty.</p>\n                    <p>Having achieved great successes against the Frisians, Pepin turned towards the Alemanni. In 709\n                        he launched a war against Willehari, duke of the Ortenau, probably in an effort to force the\n                        succession of the young sons of the deceased Gotfrid on the ducal throne. This outside\n                        interference led to another war in 712 and the Alemanni were, for the time being, restored to\n                        the Frankish fold.</p>\n                    <p>However, in southern Gaul, which was not under Arnulfing influence, the regions were pulling away\n                        from the royal court under leaders such as Savaric of Auxerre, Antenor of Provence, and Odo of\n                        Aquitaine. The reigns of Clovis IV and Childebert III from 691 until 711 have all the hallmarks\n                        of those of rois fainéants, though Childebert is founding making royal judgements against the\n                        interests of his supposed masters, the Arnulfings.</p>\n                    <h5>Death of Pepin</h5>\n                    <p>When Pepin died in 714, however, the Frankish realm plunged into civil war and the dukes of the\n                        outlying provinces became de facto independent. Pepin's appointed successor, Theudoald, under\n                        his widow, Plectrude, initially opposed an attempt by the king, Dagobert III, to appoint\n                        Ragenfrid as mayor of the palace in all the realms, but soon there was a third candidate for the\n                        mayoralty of Austrasia in Pepin's illegitimate adult son, Charles Martel.</p>\n                    <p>After the defeat of Plectrude and Theudoald by the king (now Chilperic II) and Ragenfrid, Charles\n                        briefly raised a king of his own, Chlothar IV, in opposition to Chilperic. Finally, at a battle\n                        near Soisson, Charles definitively defeated his rivals and forced them into hiding, eventually\n                        accepting the king back on the condition that he receive his father's positions (718). There\n                        were no more active Merovingian kings after that point and Charles and his Carolingian heirs\n                        ruled the Franks.</p>\n                    <p>After 718 Charles Martel embarked on a series of wars intended to strengthen the Franks' hegemony\n                        in western Europe. In 718 he defeated the rebellious Saxons, in 719 he overran Western Frisia,\n                        in 723 he suppressed the Saxons again, and in 724 he defeated Ragenfrid and the rebellious\n                        Neustrians, ending the civil war phase of his rule. In 720, when Chilperic II died, he had\n                        appointed Theuderic IV king, but this last was a mere puppet of his. In 724 he forced his choice\n                        of Hugbert for the ducal succession upon the Bavarians and forced the Alemanni to assist him in\n                        his campaigns in Bavaria (725 and 726), where laws were promulgated in Theuderic's name. In 730\n                        Alemannia had to be subjugated by the sword and its duke, Lantfrid, was killed. In 734 Charles\n                        fought against Eastern Frisia and finally subdued it.</p>\n                    <h5>Islamic invasion</h5>\n                    <p>In the 730s the Umayyad conquerors of Spain, who had also subjugated Septimania, began advancing\n                        northwards into central Francia and the Loire valley. It was at this time (circa 736) that\n                        Maurontus, the dux of Provence, called in the Umayyads to aid him in resisting the expanding\n                        influence of the Carolingians. However, Charles invaded the Rhône Valley with his brother\n                        Childebrand and a Lombard army and devastated the region. It was because of the alliance against\n                        the Arabs that Charles was unable to support Pope Gregory III against the Lombards.</p>\n                    <p>In 732 or 737—modern scholars have debated over the date—Charles marched against an Arab-berber\n                        army between Poitiers and Tours and defeated it in a watershed battle that turned back the tide\n                        of the Arab-berber advance north of the Pyrenees. But Charles's real interests lay in the\n                        northeast, primarily with the Saxons, from whom he had to extort the tribute which for centuries\n                        they had paid to the Merovingians.</p>\n                    <p>Shortly before his death in October 741, Charles divided the realm as if he were king between his\n                        two sons by his first wife, marginalising his younger son Grifo, who did receive a small portion\n                        (it is unknown exactly what). Though there had been no king since Theuderic's death in 737,\n                        Charles's sons Pepin the Younger and Carloman were still only mayors of the palaces. The\n                        Carolingians had assumed the regal status and practice, though not the regal title, of the\n                        Merovingians. The division of the kingdom gave Austrasia, Alemannia, and Thuringia to Carloman\n                        and Neustria, Provence, and Burgundy to Pepin. It is indicative of the de facto autonomy of the\n                        duchies of Aquitaine (under Hunoald) and Bavaria (under Odilo) that they were not included in\n                        the division of the regnum.</p>\n                    <p>After Charles Martel was buried, in the Abbey of Saint-Denis alongside the Merovingian kings,\n                        conflict immediately erupted between Pepin and Carloman on one side and Grifo their younger\n                        brother on the other. Though Carloman captured and imprisoned Grifo, it may have been enmity\n                        between the elder brothers that caused Pepin to release Grifo while Carloman was on a pilgrimage\n                        to Rome. Perhaps in an effort to neutralise his brother's ambitions, Carloman initiated the\n                        appointment of a new king, Childeric III, drawn from a monastery, in 743. Others have suggested\n                        that perhaps the position of the two brothers was weak or challenged, or perhaps there Carloman\n                        was merely acting for a loyalist or legitimist party in the kingdom.</p>\n                    <p>In 743 Pepin campaigned against Odilo and forced him to submit to Frankish suzerainty. Carloman\n                        also campaigned against the Saxons and the two together defeated a rebellion led by Hunoald at\n                        the head of the Basques and another led by Alemanni, in which Liutfrid of Alsatia probably died,\n                        either fighting for or against the brothers. In 746, however, the Frankish armies were still, as\n                        Carloman was preparing to retire from politics and enter the monastery of Mount Soratte. Pepin's\n                        position was further stabilised and the path was laid for his assumption of the crown in 751.\n                    </p>\n                   </div>\n                   <div id=\"art08\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                    <h4>Carolingian empire, 751–840</h4>\n                    <p>Pepin reigned as an elected king. Although such elections happened infrequently, a general rule\n                        in Germanic law stated that the king relied on the support of his leading men. These men\n                        reserved the right to choose a new \"kingworthy\" leader out of the ruling clan if they felt that\n                        the old one could not lead them in profitable battle. While in later France the kingdom became\n                        hereditary, the kings of the later Holy Roman Empire proved unable to abolish the elective\n                        tradition and continued as elected rulers until the empire's formal end in 1806.</p>\n                    <p>Pepin solidified his position in 754 by entering into an alliance with Pope Stephen II, who\n                        presented the king of the Franks a copy of the forged \"Donation of Constantine\" at Paris and in\n                        a magnificent ceremony at Saint-Denis anointed the king and his family and declared him\n                        patricius Romanorum (\"protector of the Romans\"). The following year Pepin fulfilled his promise\n                        to the pope and retrieved the Exarchate of Ravenna, recently fallen to the Lombards, and\n                        returned it to the Papacy.</p>\n                    <p>Pepin donated the re-conquered areas around Rome to the Pope, laying the foundation for the Papal\n                        States in the \"Donation of Pepin\" which he laid on the tomb of St Peter. The papacy had good\n                        cause to expect that the remade Frankish monarchy would provide a deferential power base\n                        (potestas) in the creation of a new world order, centred on the Pope.</p>\n                    <p>Upon Pepin's death in 768, his sons, Charles and Carloman, once again divided the kingdom between\n                        themselves. However, Carloman withdrew to a monastery and died shortly thereafter, leaving sole\n                        rule to his brother, who would later become known as Charlemagne or Charles the Great, a\n                        powerful, intelligent, and modestly literate figure who became a legend for the later history of\n                        both France and Germany. Charlemagne restored an equal balance between emperor and pope.</p>\n                    <p>From 772 onwards, Charles conquered and eventually defeated the Saxons to incorporate their realm\n                        into the Frankish kingdom. This campaign expanded the practice of non-Roman Christian rulers\n                        undertaking the conversion of their neighbours by armed force; Frankish Catholic missionaries,\n                        along with others from Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, had entered Saxon lands since the\n                        mid-8th century, resulting in increasing conflict with the Saxons, who resisted the missionary\n                        efforts and parallel military incursions.</p>\n                    <p>Charles's main Saxon opponent, Widukind, accepted baptism in 785 as part of a peace agreement,\n                        but other Saxon leaders continued to fight. Upon his victory in 787 at Verden, Charles ordered\n                        the wholesale killing of thousands of pagan Saxon prisoners. After several more uprisings, the\n                        Saxons suffered definitive defeat in 804. This expanded the Frankish kingdom eastwards as far as\n                        the Elbe river, something the Roman empire had only attempted once, and at which it failed in\n                        the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (9 AD). In order to more effectively Christianize the Saxons,\n                        Charles founded several bishoprics, among them Bremen, Münster, Paderborn, and Osnabrück.</p>\n                    <p>At the same time (773–774), Charles conquered the Lombards and thus included northern Italy in\n                        his sphere of influence. He renewed the Vatican donation and the promise to the papacy of\n                        continued Frankish protection.</p>\n                    <p>In 788, Tassilo, dux (duke) of Bavaria rebelled against Charles. Crushing the rebellion\n                        incorporated Bavaria into Charles's kingdom. This not only added to the royal fisc, but also\n                        drastically reduced the power and influence of the Agilolfings (Tassilo's family), another\n                        leading family among the Franks and potential rivals. Until 796, Charles continued to expand the\n                        kingdom even farther southeast, into today's Austria and parts of Croatia.</p>\n                    <p>Charles thus created a realm that reached from the Pyrenees in the southwest (actually, including\n                        an area in Northern Spain (Marca Hispanica) after 795) over almost all of today's France (except\n                        Brittany, which the Franks never conquered) eastwards to most of today's Germany, including\n                        northern Italy and today's Austria. In the hierarchy of the church, bishops and abbots looked to\n                        the patronage of the king's palace, where the sources of patronage and security lay. Charles had\n                        fully emerged as the leader of Western Christendom, and his patronage of monastic centres of\n                        learning gave rise to the \"Carolingian Renaissance\" of literate culture. Charles also created a\n                        large palace at Aachen, a series of roads, and a canal.</p>\n                    <p>On Christmas Day, 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charles as \"Emperor of the Romans\" in Rome in a\n                        ceremony presented as a surprise (Charlemagne did not wish to be indebted to the bishop of\n                        Rome), a further papal move in the series of symbolic gestures that had been defining the mutual\n                        roles of papal auctoritas and imperial potestas. Though Charlemagne preferred the title\n                        \"Emperor, king of the Franks and Lombards\", the ceremony formally acknowledged the ruler of the\n                        Franks as the Roman Emperor, triggering disputes with the Byzantine Empire, which had maintained\n                        the title since the division of the Roman Empire into East and West. The pope's right to\n                        proclaim successors was based on the Donation of Constantine, a forged Roman imperial decree.\n                        After an initial protest at the usurpation, the Byzantine Emperor Michael I Rhangabes\n                        acknowledged in 812 Charlemagne as co-emperor, according to some. According to others, Michael I\n                        reopened negotiations with the Franks in 812 and recognized Charlemagne as basileus (emperor),\n                        but not as emperor of the Romans. The coronation gave permanent legitimacy to Carolingian\n                        primacy among the Franks. The Ottonians later resurrected this connection in 962.</p>\n                    <p>Upon Charlemagne's death on 28 January 814 in Aachen, he was buried in his own Palace Chapel at\n                        Aachen.</p>\n                   </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">Francia</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Kingdom of the Franks</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">481 – 843</h2>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_year\">Germany: 768 - 843</h3>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_francia.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of Francia</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Tournai (431–508)</li>\n                                <li>Paris (508–768)</li>\n                                <li>Aachen (795–843)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">Francia</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">Life in Francia</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec03\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td>1,200,000 km<sup>2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td>UTC - UTC+1</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_francia.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map of Francia</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td>Unknown</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Frankish paganism (to 750)</li>\n                                <li>Chalcedonian Christianity (since 750)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Language</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Latin</li>\n                                <li>Frankish</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>Denier</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>Monarchy</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Kings</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Clovis I (481-511)</li>\n                                <li>Chlothar II (613-629)</li>\n                                <li>Dagobert I (629-639)</li>\n                                <li>Pepin the Short (751-768)</li>\n                                <li>Charlemagne (768-814)</li>\n                                <li>Louis the Pious (814-840)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n            </div>\n        "

The king was elected, initially by the rulers of the stem duchies, who generally chose one of their own. After 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, East Francia formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included the Kingdom of Italy and, after 1032, the Kingdom of Burgundy.</p>\n                    <p>Like medieval England and medieval France, medieval Germany consolidated from a conglomerate of smaller tribes, nations or polities by the High Middle Ages.[3] The term rex teutonicorum (\"king of the Germans\") first came into use in Italy around the year 1000.[4] It was popularized by the chancery of Pope Gregory VII during the Investiture Controversy (late 11th century), perhaps as a polemical tool against Emperor Henry IV.[5] In the twelfth century, in order to stress the imperial and transnational character of their office, the emperors began to employ the title rex Romanorum (king of the Romans) on their election.</p>\n                    <p>The Archbishop of Mainz was ex officio arch-chancellor of Germany, as his colleagues the Archbishop of Cologne and Archbishop of Trier were, respectively, arch-chancellors of Italy and Burgundy. These titles continued in use until the end of the empire, but only the German chancery actually existed.</p>\n                    <p>Distinct titulature for Germany, Italy and Burgundy, which traditionally had their own courts, laws, and chanceries,[7] gradually dropped from use as the King/Emperor's influence outside of Germany waned and the German kingdom came to be identified with the Holy Roman Empire.</p>\n                    <p>Reigns were either dated from the day a ruler was elected king (Philip of Swabia, Rudolf of Habsburg) or crowned king (Otto IV, Henry VII, Louis IV, Charles IV). The election day became the starting date permanently with Sigismund. Throughout the Middle Ages, the King of Germany was known as \"King of the Romans\" from his election as king until the Pope crowned him Emperor in Rome.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Carolingian East Francia, 843–911</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Ottonians</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Salians and Staufer</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Post-Staufer period</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Carolingian East Francia, 843–911</h4>\n                        <p>The tripartite division of the Carolingian Empire effected by the Treaty of Verdun was challenged very early on with the death of the Emperor Lothair I in 855. He had divided his kingdom of Middle Francia between his three sons and immediately the northernmost of the three divisions, Lotharingia, was disputed between the kings of East and West Francia. The war over Lotharingia lasted until 925. Lothair II of Lotharingia died in 869 and the Treaty of Meerssen (870) divided his kingdom between East and West Francia, but the West Frankish sovereigns relinquished their rightful portion to East Francia by the Treaty of Ribemont in 880. Ribemont determined the border between France and Germany until the fourteenth century. The Lotharingian nobility tried to preserve their independence of East of West Frankish rule by switching allegiance at will with the death of king Louis the Child in 911, but in 925 Lotharingia was finally ceded to East Francia by Rudolph of West Francia and it thereafter formed the Duchy of Lorraine within the East Frankish kingdom.</p>\n                        <p>Louis the German was known at the time as \"Rex Germaniae\" (King of Germany) as his brother was called King of Gaul. This was meant to distinguish the different parts of a theoretically single Frankish kingdom, although it is not known if this was meant to signify anything further.</p>\n                        <p>East Francia was itself divided into three parts at the death of Louis the German (875). Traditionally referred to as \"Saxony\", \"Bavaria\", and \"Swabia\" (or \"Alemannia\"), these kingdoms were ruled by the three sons of Louis in cooperation and were reunited by Charles the Fat in 882. Regional differences existed between the peoples of the different regions of the kingdom and each region could be readily described by contemporaries as a regnum, though each was certainly not a kingdom of its own. The common Germanic language and the tradition of common rule dating to 843 preserved political ties between the different regna and prevented the kingdom from coming apart after the death of Charles the Fat. The work of Louis the German to maintain his kingdom and give it a strong royal government also went a long way to creating an East Frankish (i.e. German) state.</p>\n                        <h5>Stem duchies</h5>\n                        <p>Within East Francia were large duchies, sometimes called kingdoms (regna) after their former status, which had a certain level of internal solidarity. Early among these were Saxony and Bavaria, which had been conquered by Charlemagne.[10] In German historiography they are called the jüngere Stammesherzogtümer, or \"younger stem duchies\",[11] The conventional five \"younger stem duchies\" of the Holy Roman Empire are Saxony, Bavaria, Franconia, Swabia and Lotharingia. Thuringia, while one of the \"old stem duchies\", is not counted among the young stem duchies because it had been absorbed into Saxony in 908, before the foundation of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>\n                        <p>The conventional term \"younger\" serves to distinguish them from the (poorly documented) duchies under the Merovingian monarchs. Herwig Wolfram (1971) denied any real distinction between older and younger stem duchies, or between the stem duchies of Germany and similar territorial principalities in other parts of the Carolingian empire:</p>\n                        <p style=\"font-style: italic;\">I am attempting to refute the whole hallowed doctrine of the difference between the beginnings of the West-Frankish, \"French\", principautés territoriales, and the East-Frankish, \"German,\" stem-duchies ... Certainly, their names had already appeared during the Migrations. Yet, their political institutional, and biological structures had more often than not thoroughly changed. I have, moreover, refuted the basic difference between the so-called älteres Stammesfürstentum [older tribal principality] and jüngeres Stammesfürstentum [younger tribal principality], since I consider the duchies before and after Charlemagne to have been basically the same Frankish institution ..</p>\n                        <p>There has been debate in modern German historiography over the sense in which these duchies were \"tribal\", as in a people sharing a common descent (\"stem\"), being governed as units over long periods of time, sharing a tribal sense of solidarity, shared customs, etc.[10] In the context of modern German nationalism, Gerd Tellenbach (1939) emphasised the role of feudalism, both of the kings in the formation of the German kingdom and of the dukes in the formation of the stem duchies, against Martin Lintzel and Walter Schlesinger, who emphasised the role of the individual \"stems\" or \"tribes\" (Stämme).[13] The existence of a \"tribal\" self-designation among Saxons and Bavarians can be asserted for the 10th and 12th centuries, respectively, although they may have existed much earlier.</p>\n                        <p>After the death of the last Carolingian, Louis the Child, in 911, the stem duchies acknowledged the unity of the kingdom. The dukes gathered and elected Conrad I to be their king. According to Tellenbach's thesis, the dukes created the duchies during Conrad's reign.[14] No duke attempted to set up an independent kingdom. Even after the death of Conrad in 918, when the election of Henry the Fowler was disputed, his rival, Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, did not establish a separate kingdom but claimed the whole,[15] before being forced by Henry to submit to royal authority.[10] Henry may even have promulgated a law stipulating that the kingdom would thereafter be united.[10] Arnulf continued to rule it like a king even after his submission, but after his death in 937 it was quickly brought under royal control by Henry's son Otto the Great.[11] The Ottonians worked to preserve the duchies as offices of the crown, but by the reign of Henry IV the dukes had made them functionally hereditary.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Ottonians</h4>\n                        <p>The eastern division of the Treaty of Verdun was called the regnum Francorum Orientalium or Francia Orientalis: the Kingdom of the Eastern Franks or simply East Francia. It was the eastern half of the old Merovingian regnum Austrasiorum. The \"east Franks\" (or Austrasians) themselves were the people of Franconia, which had been settled by Franks. The other peoples of East Francia were Saxons, Frisians, Thuringii, and the like, referred to as Teutonici (or Germans) and sometimes as Franks as ethnic identities changed over the course of the ninth century.</p>\n                        <p>An entry in the Annales Iuvavenses (or Salzburg Annals) for the year 919, roughly contemporary but surviving only in a twelfth-century copy, records that Baiuarii sponte se reddiderunt Arnolfo duci et regnare ei fecerunt in regno teutonicorum, i.e. that \"Arnulf, Duke of the Bavarians, was elected to reign in the Kingdom of the Germans\".[17] Historians disagree on whether this text is what was written in the lost original; also on the wider issue whether the idea of the Kingdom as German, rather than Frankish, dates from the tenth or the eleventh century;[18] but the idea of the kingdom as \"German\" is firmly established by the end of the eleventh century.[19] In the tenth century, German writers already tended toward using modified terms such as \"Francia and Saxony\" or \"land of the Teutons\".</p>\n                        <p>Any firm distinction between the kingdoms of Eastern Francia and Germany is to some extent the product of later retrospection. It is impossible to base this distinction on primary sources, as Eastern Francia remains in use long after Kingdom of Germany comes into use.[21] The 12th century imperial historian Otto von Freising reported that the election of Henry the Fowler was regarded as marking the beginning of the kingdom, though Otto himself disagreed with this. Thus:</p>\n                        <p style=\"font-style: italic;\">From this point some reckon a kingdom of the Germans as supplanting that of the Franks. Hence, they say that Pope Leo in the decrees of the popes, called Henry's son Otto the first king of the Germans. For that Henry of whom we are speaking refused, it is said, the honor offered by the supreme pontiff. But it seems to me that the kingdom of the Germans — which today, as we see, has possession of Rome — is a part of the kingdom of the Franks. For, as is perfectly clear in what precedes, at the time of Charles the boundaries of the kingdom of the Franks included the whole of Gaul and all Germany, from the Rhine to Illyricum. When the realm was divided between his son's sons, one part was called eastern, the other western, yet both together were called the Kingdom of the Franks. So then in the eastern part, which is called the Kingdom of the Germans, Henry was the first of the race of Saxons to succeed to the throne when the line of Charles failed ... [western Franks discussed] ... Henry's son Otto, because he restored to the German East Franks the empire which had been usurped by the Lombards, is called the first king of the Germans — not, perhaps, because he was the first king to reign among the Germans.</p>\n                        <p>It is here and elsewhere that Otto distinguishes the first German king (Henry I) and the first German king to hold imperial power (Otto I).</p>\n                        <p>Henry II (r. 1002-1024) was the first to be called \"King of the Germans\" (rex Teutonicorum).[24] The Ottonians seem to have adopted the use of the \"Teutonic\" label as it helped them to counter critics who questioned their political legitimacy as non-Carolingian Franks by presenting themselves as rulers of all peoples north of the Alps and east of the Rhine. This \"German kingdom\" was considered by them as a subdivision of the Empire alongside Italy, Burgundy and Bohemia.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Salians and Staufer</h4>\n                        <p>In the late eleventh century the term \"Kingdom of the Germans\" (Regnum Teutonicorum) had become utilised more favourably in Germany due to a growing sense of national identity;[26] by the twelfth century, German historian Otto of Freising had to explain that East Francia was \"now called the Kingdom of the Germans\".[</p>\n                        <p>In 1028, after his coronation as Emperor in 1027, Conrad II had his son, Henry III, elected King by the prince electors. When, in 1035, Conrad attempted to depose Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia, Henry, acting on the advice of his tutor, Egilbert, Bishop of Freising, refused to allow it, as Adalbero was a vassal of the King, not the Emperor. The German magnates, having legally elected Henry, would not recognise the deposition unless their king did also. After many angry protests, Conrad finally knelt before his son and pleaded for his desired consent, which was finally given.</p>\n                        <p>However, Conrad II used the simple title \"king\" or on occasion \"king of the Franks and Lombards\" before Imperial coronation, while his son Henry III introduced the title \"King of the Romans\" before the Imperial coronation.[28] His grandson Henry IV used both \"king of the Franks and Lombards\"[29] and King of the Romans before Imperial coronation.</p>\n                        <p>Beginning in the late eleventh century, during the Investiture Controversy, the Papal curia began to use the term regnum teutonicorum to refer to the realm of Henry IV in an effort to reduce him to the level of the other kings of Europe, while he himself began to use the title rex Romanorum or King of the Romans to emphasise his divine right to the imperium Romanum. This title was employed most frequently by the German kings themselves, though they did deign to employ \"Teutonic\" titles when it was diplomatic, such as Frederick Barbarossa's letter to the Pope referring to his receiving the coronam Theutonici regni (crown of the German kingdom). Foreign kings and ecclesiastics continued to refer to the regnum Alemanniae and règne or royaume d'Allemagne. The terms imperium/imperator or empire/emperor were often employed for the German kingdom and its rulers, which indicates a recognition of their imperial stature but combined with \"Teutonic\" and \"Alemannic\" references a denial of their Romanitas and universal rule. The term regnum Germaniae begins to appear even in German sources at the beginning of the fourteenth century.</p>\n                        <p>When Pope Gregory VII started using the term Regnum Teutonicorum, the concept of a \"distinct territorial kingdom\" separate from Kingdom of Italy was already widely recognised on both sides of the Alps, and this entity was at least externally perceived as \"German\" in nature. Contemporary writers representing various German vassal rulers also adopted this terminology. In the Papal-Imperial Concordat of Worms of 1122, which put an end to the Investiture Controversy, the authority of the Emperor regarding Church offices in this \"German kingdom\" was legally distinguished from his authority in \"other parts of the Empire\". The Imperial chancery did adopt the \"German\" titles, albeit inconsistently.</p>\n                        <p>In the 13th century the term Regnum Teutonicorum started being replaced in Germany by the similar Regnum Alemanniae, possibly due to French or Papal influence, or alternatively due to the Staufer emperors' base of power in the Duchy of Swabia, also known as Alamannia. Emperor Frederick II even proclaimed his son Henry VII as Rex Alemannie (King of Germany), to rule Germany under him while he ruled the rest of the empire. The Kaiserchronik explicitly describes Henry as having rule of a separate German kingdom (siniu Tiuschen riche) under the empire. Henry's successor Konrad IV was also called king-designate of Germany by a contemporary writer.</p>\n                        <p>The Count Palatine of the Rhine was legally authorised to judge on the princes' affairs should the king leave Germany (\"von teutchem lande\"). In the Sachsenspiegel and Schwabenspiegel of the Medieval German law, the vassal princes were only required to provide service to the Empire and attend court within the German lands; Frederick II or his successors were unable to call upon the German lords to Bohemia, Italy or their other domains. Royal and Imperial legislation were sometimes specifically binding only within the borders of Germany, excluding the rest of the Empire.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Post-Staufer period</h4>\n                        <p>German writers after the Staufen period used variants of the term \"Regnum Alemanniae\" to indicate the weakened reach of the emperors who now confined themselves mainly to German matters. Anti-king Henry Raspe also described himself as \"king of Germany and prince of the Romans\". There were also scattered references to a political community of \"Germans\" excluding the rest of the empire. For instance, in 1349, Charles IV met the nobles and burghers of \"regnum Alamannie\", in 1355 he summoned the electors and burghers \"in regno Alemannie\". However, this tendency to refer to a \"German\" polity after the collapse of the Staufen empire did not develop further in the following period.</p>\n                        <p>The term \"regnum\" was sometimes used to refer a distinct political entity within the \"imperium\", but sometimes they were used interchangeably, and sometimes they were combined in phrases like \"Regnum Romanorum\". In the German language it was most common to simply use the term \"German lands\" rather than \"kingdom\".[33] In 1349 Charles IV (King of the Romans) appointed the Duke of Brabant's son to govern on his behalf \"in our kingdom of the Romans throughout Germania or Theutonia\".</p>\n                        <p>There were persistent proposals, including one that Ptolemy of Lucca claimed was discussed between Pope Nicholas III and Rudolf I, to create a hereditary German kingdom independent from the Holy Empire. This idea was met with horror in Germany.[31] When Rudolf I was elected, the emotional attachment the German people had with the superior dignity of the universalistic Roman title had become so firmly established that it was unacceptable to separate the German kingship from it.[34] There was a strong reluctance by the Emperors to use \"German\" titles due to strong attachment to Roman symbolism, and it seemed to be actively avoided. References to \"German\" titles were less rare but still uncommon among vassals and chroniclers.</p>\n                        <p>From 1250 onward, the association between \"Germans\" and the whole Empire became stronger. As post-Staufer German monarchs were too weak to secure coronation as emperor, German writers became concerned that Germany was losing the prestige of Imperial status. The lack of concentration of power in one ruler or region also made the monarchy more attractive to all Germans. These led to more interest in connecting German identity to being heirs of Imperial Rome (Translatio Imperii), by right of their military strength as defenders of Christendom. At the same time, the replacement of Latin with German in official documents entrenched the German character of the empire at large. In 1474 the term \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" appeared, becoming more common after 1512. However, even after 1560, only 1 in 9 official documents mention \"Germany\", and most omitted the rest as well and simply called it \"the Empire\". In 1544 the Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster) was published, which used \"Germany\" (Teütschland) as synonymous with the empire as a whole. Johann Jacob Moser also used \"German\" as a synonym for \"Imperial\". This conflated definition of \"German\" even included non-German speakers.</p>\n                        <p>In 1508, Maximilian I, with papal approval, adopted the title \"emperor elect\" (Dei gratia Romanorum imperator electus semper augustus). Subsequent rulers adopted that title after their coronation as kings. At the same time, the custom of having the heir-apparent elected as king of the Romans in the emperor's lifetime resumed. For this reason, the title \"king of the Romans\" (rex Romanorum) came to mean heir-apparent, the successor elected while the emperor was still alive.</p>\n                        <p>After the Imperial Reform and Reformation settlement, the German part of the Holy Roman Empire was divided into Reichskreise (Imperial Circles), which in effect defined Germany against imperial territories outside the Imperial Circles: imperial Italy, the Bohemian Kingdom, and the Old Swiss Confederacy.[38] Brendan Simms called the Imperial circles as \"an embryonic German collective-security system\" and \"a potential vehicle for national unity against outsiders\".</p>\n                        <p>Nevertheless, there are relatively few references to a German kingdom distinct from the Holy Roman Empire.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">Kingdom of Germany</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Kingdom of the East Franks</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">843-962</h2>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_year\">Germany: 843-962</h3>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_eastfrancia.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of Kingdom of Germany</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Frankfurt</li>\n                                <li>Ratisbon</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">Kingdom of Germany</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td>357,022 km<sup>2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td>UTC+1</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_eastfrancia.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map of Kingdom of Germany</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td>~5,000,000</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td>Catholic Church</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Language</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Old High German</li>\n                                <li>Old Low German</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>Pfennig</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>Monarchy</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Emperors</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Louis the German (873-876)</li>\n                                <li>Otto the Great (936-962)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n            </div>\n        "},

At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, most of the Holy Roman Empire was\n                        included in the German Confederation.</p>\n                    <p>On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor, reviving the\n                        title in Western Europe, more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western\n                        Roman Empire in 476. In theory and diplomacy, the Emperors were considered primus inter pares,\n                        regarded as first among equals among other Roman Catholic monarchs across Europe.[12] The title\n                        continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested\n                        by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant,\n                        Berengar I, in 924. The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I, King of Germany, was crowned\n                        emperor, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne[13] and beginning a continuous\n                        existence of the empire for over eight centuries.[14][15][16] Some historians refer to the\n                        coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire,[17][18] while others prefer the\n                        coronation of Otto I as its beginning.[19][20] Scholars generally concur, however, in relating\n                        an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire, describing a gradual\n                        assumption of the imperial title and role.</p>\n                    <p>The exact term \"Holy Roman Empire\" was not used until the 13th century, before which the empire\n                        was referred to variously as universum regnum (\"the whole kingdom\", as opposed to the regional\n                        kingdoms), imperium christianum (\"Christian empire\"), or Romanum imperium (\"Roman empire\"),[21]\n                        but the Emperor's legitimacy always rested on the concept of translatio imperii,[d] that he held\n                        supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome.[9] The dynastic office of Holy Roman\n                        Emperor was traditionally elective through the mostly German prince-electors, the\n                        highest-ranking noblemen of the empire; they would elect one of their peers as \"King of the\n                        Romans\" to be crowned emperor by the Pope, although the tradition of papal coronations was\n                        discontinued in the 16th century.</p>\n                    <p>The empire never achieved the extent of political unification as was formed to the west in the\n                        relatively centralised Kingdom of France, evolving instead into a decentralised, limited\n                        elective monarchy composed of hundreds of sub-units: kingdoms, principalities, duchies,\n                        counties, prince-bishoprics, Free Imperial Cities, and other domains.[10][22] The power of the\n                        emperor was limited, and while the various princes, lords, bishops, and cities of the empire\n                        were vassals who owed the emperor their allegiance, they also possessed an extent of privileges\n                        that gave them de facto independence within their territories. Emperor Francis II dissolved the\n                        empire on 6 August 1806 following the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine by Emperor\n                        Napoleon I the month before.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Name</h3>\n                    <p>The Empire was considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only legal successor of the\n                        Roman Empire during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. Since Charlemagne, the realm\n                        was merely referred to as the Roman Empire.[23] The term sacrum (\"holy\", in the sense of\n                        \"consecrated\") in connection with the medieval Roman Empire was used beginning in 1157 under\n                        Frederick I Barbarossa (\"Holy Empire\"): the term was added to reflect Frederick's ambition to\n                        dominate Italy and the Papacy.[24] The form \"Holy Roman Empire\" is attested from 1254 onward.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>In a decree following the Diet of Cologne in 1512, the name was changed to the Holy Roman Empire\n                        of the German Nation (German: Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation, Latin: Sacrum Imperium\n                        Romanum Nationis Germanicæ),[26] a form first used in a document in 1474.[24] The new title was\n                        adopted partly because the Empire had lost most of its territories in Italy and Burgundy (the\n                        Kingdom of Arles) to the south and west by the late 15th century,[27] but also to emphasize the\n                        new importance of the German Imperial Estates in ruling the Empire due to the Imperial Reform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>By the end of the 18th century, the term \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" had fallen out\n                        of official use. Contradicting the traditional view concerning that designation, Hermann Weisert\n                        has argued in a study on imperial titulature that, despite the claims of many textbooks, the\n                        name \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" never had an official status and points out that\n                        documents were thirty times as likely to omit the national suffix as include it.</p>\n                    <p>In a famous assessment of the name, the political philosopher Voltaire remarked sardonically:\n                        \"This body which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was in no way\n                        holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.\"</p>\n                    <p>In the modern period, the Empire was often informally called the German Empire (Deutsches Reich)\n                        or Roman-German Empire (Römisch-Deutsches Reich).[31] After its dissolution through the end of\n                        the German Empire, it was often called \"the old Empire\" (das alte Reich). Beginning in 1923,\n                        early-twentieth century German nationalists and Nazi propaganda would identify the Holy Roman\n                        Empire as the First Reich (Reich meaning empire), with the German Empire as the Second Reich and\n                        either a future German nationalist state or Nazi Germany as the Third Reich.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>Institutions</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Summary</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Imperial estates</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">King of the Romans</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Imperial Diet (Reichstag)</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn05\">Imperial courts</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn06\">Imperial circles</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn07\">Army</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn08\">Administrative centres</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn09\">Foreign relations</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <p>The Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized state nor a nation-state. Instead, it was\n                            divided into dozens – eventually hundreds – of individual entities governed by kings,[70]\n                            dukes, counts, bishops, abbots, and other rulers, collectively known as princes. There were\n                            also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue\n                            decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the\n                            various local leaders.</p>\n                        <p>From the High Middle Ages onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence\n                            with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take power away from it. To\n                            a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as France and England, the emperors\n                            were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure\n                            their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and\n                            more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th\n                            century with the Investiture Controversy and was more or less concluded with the 1648 Peace\n                            of Westphalia. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority\n                            but were thwarted both by the papacy and by the princes of the Empire.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <p>The number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about\n                            300 at the time of the Peace of Westphalia. Many of these Kleinstaaten (\"little states\")\n                            covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so\n                            the Empire was often called a Flickenteppich (\"patchwork carpet\"). An entity was considered\n                            a Reichsstand (imperial estate) if, according to feudal law, it had no authority above it\n                            except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Territories in which secular authority was held by an ecclesiastical dignitary, such as\n                                an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such an ecclesiastic or Churchman was a prince of the\n                                Church. In the common case of a prince-bishop, this temporal territory (called a\n                                prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often larger ecclesiastical diocese,\n                                giving the bishop both civil and ecclesiastical powers.

German kings had been elected since the 9th century; at that point\n                            they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the Salian Franks of\n                            Lorraine, Ripuarian Franks of Franconia, Saxons, Bavarians, and Swabians). In the Holy Roman\n                            Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans.</p>\n                        <p>In 1356, Emperor Charles IV issued the Golden Bull, which limited the electors to seven: the\n                            King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony, the Margrave of\n                            Brandenburg, and the archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, and Trier. During the Thirty Years' War,\n                            the Duke of Bavaria was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the Duke of\n                            Brunswick-Lüneburg (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the\n                            Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors\n                            never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to\n                            offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.</p>\n                        <p>After being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\"\n                            only after being crowned by the Pope. In many cases, this took several years while the King\n                            was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious\n                            northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the\n                            papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling Emperor-Elect: the last Emperor\n                            to be crowned by the Pope was Charles V in 1530.</p>\n                        <p>The Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as\n                            the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether\n                            and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts\n                            in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were\n                            not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a\n                            candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <p>The Imperial Diet (Reichstag, or Reichsversammlung) was not a legislative body as we\n                            understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was\n                            more important to negotiate than to decide.[73] The Diet was theoretically superior to the\n                            emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the Council of\n                            Electors, consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans.\n                            The second class, the Council of Princes, consisted of the other princes. The Council of\n                            Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical\n                            ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped\n                            into \"colleges\" by geography.

The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it\n                            could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories.

He eventually incorporated the territories of present-day France, Germany,\n                            northern Italy, the Low Countries and beyond, linking the Frankish kingdom with Papal lands.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>Although antagonism about the expense of Byzantine domination had long persisted within\n                            Italy, a political rupture was set in motion in earnest in 726 by the iconoclasm of Emperor\n                            Leo III the Isaurian, in what Pope Gregory II saw as the latest in a series of imperial\n                            heresies.[42] In 797, the Eastern Roman Emperor Constantine VI was removed from the throne\n                            by his mother Irene who declared herself Empress. As the Latin Church, influenced by Gothic\n                            law forbidding female leadership and property ownership,[citation needed] only regarded a\n                            male Roman Emperor as the head of Christendom, Pope Leo III sought a new candidate for the\n                            dignity, excluding consultation with the Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>\n                        <p>Charlemagne's good service to the Church in his defense of Papal possessions against the\n                            Lombards made him the ideal candidate. On Christmas Day of 800, Pope Leo III crowned\n                            Charlemagne emperor, restoring the title in the West for the first time in over three\n                            centuries.[45][46] This can be seen as symbolic of the papacy turning away from the\n                            declining Byzantine Empire towards the new power of Carolingian Francia. Charlemagne adopted\n                            the formula Renovatio imperii Romanorum (\"renewal of the Roman Empire\"). In 802, Irene was\n                            overthrown and exiled by Nikephoros I and henceforth there were two Roman Emperors.</p>\n                        <p>After Charlemagne died in 814, the imperial crown passed to his son, Louis the Pious. Upon\n                            Louis' death in 840, it passed to his son Lothair, who had been his co-ruler. By this point\n                            the territory of Charlemagne had been divided into several territories (cf. Treaty of\n                            Verdun, Treaty of Prüm, Treaty of Meerssen and Treaty of Ribemont), and over the course of\n                            the later ninth century the title of Emperor was disputed by the Carolingian rulers of\n                            Western Francia and Eastern Francia, with first the western king (Charles the Bald) and then\n                            the eastern (Charles the Fat), who briefly reunited the Empire, attaining the prize.</p>\n                        <p>After the death of Charles the Fat in 888 the Carolingian Empire broke apart, and was never\n                            restored. According to Regino of Prüm, the parts of the realm \"spewed forth kinglets\", and\n                            each part elected a kinglet \"from its own bowels\".[48] After the death of Charles the Fat,\n                            those crowned emperor by the pope controlled only territories in Italy.[citation needed] The\n                            last such emperor was Berengar I of Italy, who died in 924.</p>\n                        <h5>Formation of the Holy Roman Empire</h5>\n                        <p>Around 900, autonomous stem duchies (Franconia, Bavaria, Swabia, Saxony, and Lotharingia)\n                            reemerged in East Francia. After the Carolingian king Louis the Child died without issue in\n                            911, East Francia did not turn to the Carolingian ruler of West Francia to take over the\n                            realm but instead elected one of the dukes, Conrad of Franconia, as Rex Francorum\n                            Orientalium.[49]:117 On his deathbed, Conrad yielded the crown to his main rival, Henry the\n                            Fowler of Saxony (r. 919–36), who was elected king at the Diet of Fritzlar in 919.[49]:118\n                            Henry reached a truce with the raiding Magyars, and in 933 he won a first victory against\n                            them in the Battle of Riade.</p>\n                        <p>Henry died in 936, but his descendants, the Liudolfing (or Ottonian) dynasty, would continue\n                            to rule the Eastern kingdom for roughly a century. Upon Henry the Fowler's death, Otto, his\n                            son and designated successor,[50] was elected King in Aachen in 936.[51]:706 He overcame a\n                            series of revolts from a younger brother and from several dukes. After that, the king\n                            managed to control the appointment of dukes and often also employed bishops in\n                            administrative affairs.</p>\n                        <p>In 951, Otto came to the aid of Adelaide, the widowed queen of Italy, defeating her enemies,\n                            marrying her, and taking control over Italy.[52]:214–15 In 955, Otto won a decisive victory\n                            over the Magyars in the Battle of Lechfeld.[51]:707 In 962, Otto was crowned emperor by Pope\n                            John XII,[51]:707 thus intertwining the affairs of the German kingdom with those of Italy\n                            and the Papacy. Otto's coronation as Emperor marked the German kings as successors to the\n                            Empire of Charlemagne, which through the concept of translatio imperii, also made them\n                            consider themselves as successors to Ancient Rome.</p>\n                        <p>The kingdom had no permanent capital city.[53] Kings traveled between residences (called\n                            Kaiserpfalz) to discharge affairs, though each king preferred certain places; in Otto's\n                            case, this was the city of Magdeburg. Kingship continued to be transferred by election, but\n                            Kings often ensured their own sons were elected during their lifetimes, enabling them to\n                            keep the crown for their families. This only changed after the end of the Salian dynasty in\n                            the 12th century.</p>\n                        <p>In 963, Otto deposed the current Pope John XII and chose Pope Leo VIII as the new pope\n                            (although John XII and Leo VIII both claimed the papacy until 964 when John XII died). This\n                            also renewed the conflict with the Eastern Emperor in Constantinople, especially after\n                            Otto's son Otto II (r. 967–83) adopted the designation imperator Romanorum. Still, Otto II\n                            formed marital ties with the east when he married the Byzantine princess Theophanu.[51]:708\n                            Their son, Otto III, came to the throne only three years old, and was subjected to a power\n                            struggle and series of regencies until his age of majority in 994. Up to that time, he had\n                            remained in Germany, while a deposed duke, Crescentius II, ruled over Rome and part of\n                            Italy, ostensibly in his stead.</p>\n                        <p>In 996 Otto III appointed his cousin Gregory V the first German Pope.[54] A foreign pope and\n                            foreign papal officers were seen with suspicion by Roman nobles, who were led by Crescentius\n                            II to revolt. Otto III's former mentor Antipope John XVI briefly held Rome, until the Holy\n                            Roman Emperor seized the city.</p>\n                        <p>Otto died young in 1002, and was succeeded by his cousin Henry II, who focused on Germany.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>Henry II died in 1024 and Conrad II, first of the Salian Dynasty, was elected king only after\n                            some debate among dukes and nobles. This group eventually developed into the college of\n                            Electors.</p>\n                        <p>The Holy Roman Empire became eventually composed of four kingdoms. The kingdoms were:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>Kingdom of Germany (part of the empire since 962)</li>\n                            <li>Kingdom of Italy (from 962 until 1648)</li>\n                            <li>Kingdom of Bohemia (since 1002 as the Duchy of Bohemia and raised to a kingdom in 1198)\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Kingdom of Burgundy (from 1032 to 1378)</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art13\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>High Middle Ages</h4>\n                        <h5>Investiture controversy</h5>\n                        <p>Kings often employed bishops in administrative affairs and often determined who would be\n                            appointed to ecclesiastical offices.[56]:101–134 In the wake of the Cluniac Reforms, this\n                            involvement was increasingly seen as inappropriate by the Papacy. The reform-minded Pope\n                            Gregory VII was determined to oppose such practices, which led to the Investiture\n                            Controversy with Henry IV (r. 1056–1106), the King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperor.</p>\n                        <p>Henry IV repudiated the Pope's interference and persuaded his bishops to excommunicate the\n                            Pope, whom he famously addressed by his born name \"Hildebrand\", rather than his regnal name\n                            \"Pope Gregory VII\".[56]:109 The Pope, in turn, excommunicated the king, declared him\n                            deposed, and dissolved the oaths of loyalty made to Henry.[14][56]:109 The king found\n                            himself with almost no political support and was forced to make the famous Walk to Canossa\n                            in 1077,[56]:122–24 by which he achieved a lifting of the excommunication at the price of\n                            humiliation. Meanwhile, the German princes had elected another king, Rudolf of Swabia.</p>\n                        <p>Henry managed to defeat him but was subsequently confronted with more uprisings, renewed\n                            excommunication, and even the rebellion of his sons. After his death, his second son, Henry\n                            V, reached an agreement with the Pope and the bishops in the 1122 Concordat of\n                            Worms.[56]:123–34 The political power of the Empire was maintained, but the conflict had\n                            demonstrated the limits of the ruler's power, especially in regard to the Church, and it\n                            robbed the king of the sacral status he had previously enjoyed. The Pope and the German\n                            princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.</p>\n                        <h5>Ostsiedlung</h5>\n                        <p>As the result of Ostsiedlung, less-populated regions of Central Europe (i.e. the territory of\n                            today's Poland and Czech Republic) became German-speaking. Silesia became part of the Holy\n                            Roman Empire as the result of the local Piast dukes' push for autonomy from the Polish\n                            Crown.[57] From the late 12th century, the Griffin Duchy of Pomerania was under the\n                            suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire[58] and the conquests of the Teutonic Order made the\n                            Baltic region German-speaking.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art14\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Hohenstaufen dynasty</h4>\n                        <p>When the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect\n                            the next of kin, but rather Lothair, the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony.\n                            When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not\n                            elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law Henry the Proud of the Welf family, but Conrad\n                            III of the Hohenstaufen family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of\n                            Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted\n                            the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew Frederick I\n                            \"Barbarossa\" succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin Henry the\n                            Lion to his – albeit diminished – possessions.</p>\n                        <p>The Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ministerialia, formerly non-free\n                            servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for\n                            war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later knights, another\n                            basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the\n                            establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the Landfrieden, with the\n                            first imperial one being issued in 1103 under Henry IV at Mainz.</p>\n                        <p>This was an attempt to abolish private feuds, between the many dukes and other people, and to\n                            tie the Emperor's subordinates to a legal system of jurisdiction and public prosecution of\n                            criminal acts – a predecessor of the modern concept of \"rule of law\". Another new concept of\n                            the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes.\n                            These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic\n                            power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman\n                            foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include\n                            Freiburg, possibly the economic model for many later cities, and Munich.</p>\n                        <p>Frederick I, also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the\n                            \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor\n                            independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia\n                            in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis. Imperial\n                            rights had been referred to as regalia since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated\n                            for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs,\n                            coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office\n                            holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional\n                            act.</p>\n                        <p>Frederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly\n                            wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially Milan. He also embroiled himself in\n                            another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against\n                            Pope Alexander III (1159–81). Frederick supported a succession of antipopes before finally\n                            making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry\n                            the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of Munich\n                            and Lübeck). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical\n                            situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support.\n                            After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke,\n                            resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick\n                            participated in the Third Crusade and died in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.</p>\n                        <p>During the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful eastward\n                            settlement of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by West Slavs.\n                            German-speaking farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both\n                            Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual Germanization of these lands was a\n                            complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century\n                            nationalism. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include\n                            Pomerania and Silesia, as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers\n                            with German spouses. The Teutonic Knights were invited to Prussia by Duke Konrad of Masovia\n                            to Christianize the Prussians in 1226. The monastic state of the Teutonic Order (German:\n                            Deutschordensstaat) and its later German successor state of Prussia were never part of the\n                            Holy Roman Empire.</p>\n                        <p>Under the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, Henry VI, the Hohenstaufen dynasty\n                            reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king\n                            Richard the Lionheart captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in\n                            1197. As his son, Frederick II, though already elected king, was still a small child and\n                            living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual\n                            election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son Philip of Swabia and Henry the Lion's son\n                            Otto of Brunswick, who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was\n                            murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.</p>\n                        <p>Pope Innocent III, who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now\n                            supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory,\n                            Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made\n                            his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political\n                            power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing\n                            Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another\n                            point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed.\n                            Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the Sixth Crusade in 1228, which ended in\n                            negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.</p>\n                        <p>Despite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the\n                            disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern,\n                            centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching\n                            privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 Confoederatio cum\n                            principibus ecclesiasticis, Frederick gave up a number of regalia in favour of the bishops,\n                            among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 Statutum in favorem principum\n                            mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges\n                            had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the\n                            German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy.\n                            The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called domini terræ,\n                            owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.</p>\n                        <h5>Kingdom of Bohemia</h5>\n                        <p>The Kingdom of Bohemia was a significant regional power during the Middle Ages. In 1212, King\n                            Ottokar I (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a Golden Bull of Sicily (a formal\n                            edict) from the emperor Frederick II, confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his\n                            descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt\n                            from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the\n                            imperial councils. Charles IV set Prague to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.</p>\n                        <h5>Interregnum</h5>\n                        <p>After the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son\n                            Conrad IV (died 1254) and the anti-king, William of Holland (died 1256). Conrad's death was\n                            followed by the Interregnum, during which no king could achieve universal recognition,\n                            allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers.\n                            After 1257, the crown was contested between Richard of Cornwall, who was supported by the\n                            Guelph party, and Alfonso X of Castile, who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but\n                            never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, Rudolf I of Germany, a minor\n                            pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the Habsburgs to hold a royal title, but\n                            he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, Adolf and Albert were two\n                            further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.</p>\n                        <p>Albert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began\n                            aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King\n                            of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established\n                            at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the\n                            French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the\n                            German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne,\n                            a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all\n                            Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.</p>\n                        <p>Instead, Henry VII, of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27\n                            November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was\n                            bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the\n                            electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for\n                            decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother,\n                            Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in\n                            exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January\n                            1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.</p>\n                        <h5>Changes in political structure</h5>\n                        <p>During the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared\n                            the shift of political power towards the rising bourgeoisie at the expense of the\n                            aristocratic feudalism that would characterize the Late Middle Ages. The rise of the cities\n                            and the emergence of the new burgher class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of\n                            feudalism.[63] Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to\n                            represent economic value in agriculture.</p>\n                        <p>Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\"\n                            began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied\n                            together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly\n                            bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However,\n                            that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent\n                            until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or\n                            rules described as customary.</p>\n                        <p>During this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The\n                            process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories\n                            that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, e.g., Bavaria. It was\n                            slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.</p>\n                        <p>In the 12th century the Hanseatic League established itself as a commercial and defensive\n                            alliance of the merchant guilds of towns and cities in the empire and all over northern and\n                            central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and along the\n                            connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its\n                            sovereign and, with the exception of the Free imperial cities, had only a limited degree of\n                            political autonomy. By the late 14th century the powerful league enforced its interests with\n                            military means, if necessary. This culminated in a war with the sovereign Kingdom of Denmark\n                            from 1361 to 1370. The league declined after 1450.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art15\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Late Middle Ages</h4>\n                        <h5>Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufens</h5>\n                        <p>The difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of\n                            prince-electors (Kurfürsten), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the Golden\n                            Bull of 1356, which remained valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolizes the\n                            emerging duality between emperor and realm (Kaiser und Reich), which were no longer\n                            considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy\n                            Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all\n                            seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to\n                            mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the\n                            imperial languages – German, Latin, Italian, and Czech.</p>\n                        <p>The shift in power away from the emperor is also revealed in the way the post-Hohenstaufen\n                            kings attempted to sustain their power. Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances)\n                            greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called Reichsgut, which always belonged to\n                            the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance\n                            of the Reichsgut faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in\n                            1806. Instead, the Reichsgut was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise\n                            money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to\n                            establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the Reichsgut no longer matched\n                            the needs of either the king or the dukes.</p>\n                        <p>The kings beginning with Rudolf I of Germany increasingly relied on the lands of their\n                            respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the Reichsgut, which was\n                            mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and\n                            thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and Styria to his own sons. In\n                            1312, Henry VII of the House of Luxembourg was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since\n                            Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family\n                            (Hausmacht): Louis IV of Wittelsbach (king 1314, emperor 1328–47) relied on his lands in\n                            Bavaria; Charles IV of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own\n                            lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the\n                            power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as\n                            well.</p>\n                        <h5>Imperial reform</h5>\n                        <p>The \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the\n                            15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the\n                            Golden Bull of 1356, the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should\n                            cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It\n                            therefore proved somewhat damaging that Sigismund of Luxemburg (king 1410, emperor\n                            1433–1437) and Frederick III of Habsburg (king 1440, emperor 1452–1493) neglected the old\n                            core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the\n                            king, the old institution of the Hoftag, the assembly of the realm's leading men,\n                            deteriorated. The Imperial Diet as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that\n                            time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other – feuds that, more often than not,\n                            escalated into local wars.</p>\n                        <p>Simultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects\n                            in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two anti-popes and the\n                            \"legitimate\" Pope) ended only with the Council of Constance (1414–1418); after 1419 the\n                            Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the Hussites. The medieval idea of\n                            unifying all Christendom into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as\n                            its leading institutions, began to decline.</p>\n                        <p>With these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire\n                            itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a\n                            reinforcement of earlier Landfrieden was urgently needed. While older scholarship presented\n                            this period as a time of total disorder and near-anarchy, new research has reassessed the\n                            German lands in the 15th century in a more positive light. Landfrieden was not only a matter\n                            imposed by kings (which might disappear in their absence), but was also upheld by regional\n                            leagues and alliances (also called \"associations\").</p>\n                        <p>Princes, nobles and/or cities collaborated to keep the peace by adhering to collective\n                            treaties which stipulated methods for resolving disputes (ad hoc courts and arbitration) and\n                            joint military measures to defeat outlaws and declarers of feuds. Nevertheless, some members\n                            of the imperial estates (notably Berthold von Henneberg, archbishop of Mainz) sought a more\n                            centralized and institutionalized approach to regulating peace and justice, as (supposedly)\n                            had existed in earlier centuries of the Empire's history. During this time, the concept of\n                            \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb re-formare – to regain an earlier\n                            shape that had been lost.</p>\n                        <p>When Frederick III needed the dukes to finance a war against Hungary in 1486, and at the same\n                            time had his son (later Maximilian I) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes\n                            for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the\n                            electors and other dukes was now called the Imperial Diet (German Reichstag) (to be joined\n                            by the Imperial Free Cities later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son\n                            finally convened the Diet at Worms in 1495, after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king\n                            and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the Reichsreform (Imperial\n                            Reform): a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure.</p>\n                        <p>For example, this act produced the Imperial Circle Estates and the Reichskammergericht\n                            (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would – to a degree – persist until the end of\n                            the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal\n                            acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were\n                            finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the Reichshofrat, continued\n                            to operate in parallel to the Reichskammergericht. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new\n                            title, the Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German\n                            Nation\").</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art16\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Reformation and Renaissance</h4>\n                        <p>In 1516, Ferdinand II of Aragon, grandfather of the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V,\n                            died.[69] Due to a combination of (1) the traditions of dynastic succession in Aragon, which\n                            permitted maternal inheritance with no precedence for female rule; (2) the insanity of\n                            Charles's mother, Joanna of Castile; and (3) the insistence by his remaining grandfather,\n                            Maximilian I, that he take up his royal titles, Charles initiated his reign in Castile and\n                            Aragon, a union which evolved into Spain, in conjunction with his mother. This ensured for\n                            the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under\n                            one nascent Spanish crown.</p>\n                        <p>The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already\n                            reigning as Carlos I in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as Karl V. The balance\n                            (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign\n                            and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be\n                            short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the\n                            person of Charles's brother Ferdinand, while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain\n                            and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, Philip II of Spain.</p>\n                        <p>In addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion\n                            would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in\n                            the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, Martin Luther launched what would later be known as\n                            the Reformation. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of\n                            Emperor Charles V. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the\n                            north, the east, and many of the major cities – Strasbourg, Frankfurt, and Nuremberg –\n                            becoming Protestant while the southern and western regions largely remained Catholic.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art17\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Baroque period</h4>\n                        <p>Charles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of\n                            his reign. After his son Philip married Queen Mary of England, it appeared that France would\n                            be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the\n                            marriage produced no children. In 1555, Paul IV was elected pope and took the side of\n                            France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian\n                            empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria.\n                            The Peace of Augsburg ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of Protestantism\n                            in the form of Lutheranism, while Calvinism was still not recognized. Anabaptist, Arminian\n                            and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.</p>\n                        <p>Germany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks\n                            continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the\n                            Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland\n                            increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the\n                            Empire remained neutral, de facto allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a\n                            secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the Cologne War, which ravaged much of the\n                            upper Rhine.</p>\n                        <p>After Ferdinand died in 1564, his son Maximilian II became Emperor, and like his father\n                            accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it.\n                            Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by Rudolf II, a strange man who preferred classical Greek\n                            philosophy to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to\n                            act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and\n                            the Protestant princes became upset over this.</p>\n                        <p>Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians\n                            rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the\n                            Thirty Years' War (1618–48), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France\n                            and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but\n                            also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that\n                            it never recovered its strength.</p>\n                        <p>The actual end of the empire came in several steps. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which\n                            ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. Calvinism\n                            was now allowed, but Anabaptists, Arminians and other Protestant communities would still\n                            lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The Swiss\n                            Confederation, which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the\n                            Northern Netherlands, left the Empire. The Habsburg Emperors focused on consolidating their\n                            own estates in Austria and elsewhere.</p>\n                        <p>At the Battle of Vienna (1683), the Army of the Holy Roman Empire, led by the Polish King\n                            John III Sobieski, decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman\n                            advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire in Europe. The army\n                            was half forces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, mostly cavalry, and half forces of\n                            the Holy Roman Empire, mostly infantry.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art18\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Modern period</h4>\n                        <h5>Prussia and Austria</h5>\n                        <p>By the rise of Louis XIV, the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their hereditary lands to\n                            counter the rise of Prussia, which possessed territories inside the Empire. Throughout the\n                            18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the War of\n                            the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1735), and the\n                            War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The German dualism between Austria and Prussia\n                            dominated the empire's history after 1740.</p>\n                        <h5>French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution</h5>\n                        <p>From 1792 onwards, revolutionary France was at war with various parts of the Empire\n                            intermittently.</p>\n                        <p>The German mediatization was the series of mediatizations and secularizations that occurred\n                            between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the French Revolution and then\n                            the Napoleonic Era. \"Mediatization\" was the process of annexing the lands of one imperial\n                            estate to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the\n                            Imperial Knights were formally mediatized in 1806, having de facto been seized by the great\n                            territorial states in 1803 in the so-called Rittersturm. \"Secularization\" was the abolition\n                            of the temporal power of an ecclesiastical ruler such as a bishop or an abbot and the\n                            annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.</p>\n                        <p>The empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II (from\n                            1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French\n                            under Napoleon at Austerlitz (see Treaty of Pressburg). Napoleon reorganized much of the\n                            Empire into the Confederation of the Rhine, a French satellite. Francis' House of\n                            Habsburg-Lorraine survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as Emperors of\n                            Austria and Kings of Hungary until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the\n                            aftermath of World War I.</p>\n                        <p>The Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the German\n                            Confederation in 1815, following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. It lasted until 1866 when\n                            Prussia founded the North German Confederation, a forerunner of the German Empire which\n                            united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian\n                            leadership in 1871. This state developed into modern Germany.</p>\n                        <p>The only princely member states of the Holy Roman Empire that have preserved their status as\n                            monarchies until today are the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Principality of\n                            Liechtenstein.

Its capital was Berlin.</p>\n                    <p>The kings of Prussia were from the House of Hohenzollern. Brandenburg-Prussia, predecessor of the\n                        kingdom, became a military power under Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, known as \"The\n                        Great Elector\".[5][6][7][8] As a kingdom, Prussia continued its rise to power, especially during\n                        the reign of Frederick II, more commonly known as Frederick the Great, who was the third son of\n                        Frederick William I.[9] Frederick the Great was instrumental in starting the Seven Years' War\n                        (1756-63), holding his own against Austria, Russia, France and Sweden and establishing Prussia's\n                        role in the German states, as well as establishing the country as a European great power.[10]\n                        After the might of Prussia was revealed it was considered as a major power among the German\n                        states. Throughout the next hundred years Prussia went on to win many battles, and many\n                        wars.[11] Because of its power, Prussia continuously tried to unify all the German states\n                        (excluding the German cantons in Switzerland) under its rule, and whether Austria would be\n                        included in such a unified German domain was an ongoing question.</p>\n                    <p>After the Napoleonic Wars led to the creation of the German Confederation, the issue of unifying\n                        the German states caused a number of revolutions throughout the German states, with all states\n                        wanting to have their own constitution.[3] Attempts to create a federation remained unsuccessful\n                        and the German Confederation collapsed in 1866 when war ensued between its two most powerful\n                        member states, Prussia and Austria. The North German Confederation, which lasted from 1867 to\n                        1871, created a closer union between the Prussian-aligned states while Austria and most of\n                        Southern Germany remained independent.[3] The North German Confederation was seen as more of an\n                        alliance of military strength in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War but many of its laws\n                        were later used in the German Empire. The German Empire lasted from 1871 to 1918 with the\n                        successful unification of all the German states aside from Austria under Prussian hegemony;[3]\n                        this was due to the defeat of Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The war united\n                        all the German states against a common enemy, and with the victory came an overwhelming wave of\n                        nationalism which changed the opinions of some of those who had been against unification. In\n                        1871, Germany unified into a single country, minus Austria and Switzerland, with Prussia the\n                        dominant power.</p>\n                    <p>Prussia is considered the legal predecessor of the unified German Reich (1871–1945) and as such a\n                        direct ancestor of today's Federal Republic of Germany.[3] The formal abolition of Prussia,\n                        carried out on 25 February 1947 by the fiat of the Allied Control Council, referred to an\n                        alleged tradition of the kingdom as a bearer of militarism and reaction, and made way for the\n                        current setup of the German states. However, the Free State of Prussia (Freistaat Preußen),\n                        which followed the abolition of the Kingdom of Prussia in the aftermath of World War I, was a\n                        major democratic force in Weimar Germany until the nationalist coup of 1932 known as the\n                        Preußenschlag.[citation needed] The Kingdom left a significant cultural legacy, today notably\n                        promoted by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz (SPK)),\n                        which has become one of the largest cultural organisations in the world.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>State</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Government</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Politics</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Constitutions</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Government</h4>\n                        <p>The joint authority, feudal and bureaucratic, on which Prussian absolute monarchy was based,\n                            saw its interests laid in suppression of the drive for personal freedom and democratic\n                            rights. It therefore had to recourse on police methods.[24] The \"police state\", as Otto\n                            Hintze described it, replaced the older system with its feudal squirearchy run in the\n                            interests of the ruling class, but which in its rudimentary form was a constitutional state.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Politics</h4>\n                        <p>The Kingdom of Prussia was an absolute monarchy until the Revolutions of 1848 in the German\n                            states, after which Prussia became a constitutional monarchy and Adolf Heinrich von\n                            Arnim-Boitzenburg was appointed as Prussia's first prime minister. Following Prussia's first\n                            constitution, a two-house parliament was formed. The lower house, or Landtag was elected by\n                            all taxpayers, who were divided into three classes according to the amount of taxes paid.\n                            This allowed just over 25% of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring\n                            dominance by the more well-to-do elements of the population. The upper house, which was\n                            later renamed the Prussian House of Lords, was appointed by the king. He retained full\n                            executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the\n                            landowning classes, the Prussian Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern\n                            provinces. Prussian Secret Police, formed in response to the Revolutions of 1848 in the\n                            German states, aided the conservative government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Constitutions</h4>\n                        <p>There were two constitutions during the kingdom's existence, the 1848 and 1850. The\n                            constitution of 1848 was enacted and set into effect on 5 December 1848, by Frederick\n                            William IV. This was set out in response to the revolutions of 1848. The second constitution\n                            was enacted on 31 January 1850 and was continually amended in the following years.</p>\n                        <p>The Constitution of 1848 occurred under the rule of Frederick William IV who took power from\n                            his father after his death in the year 1840. After taking power, William set an appointment\n                            of committees to confer on points of various questions. With this the king believed that he\n                            could give a sense of unity without revolution. The government was then cautiously brought\n                            together, all members of the eight provincial assemblies, and split into two houses, a house\n                            of lords and a second house that enveloped the three estates of the knights, the burgesses\n                            and the peasants. Although they had no real power and the king did not consult them or allow\n                            them to veto or argue the legislatures that were being made, it was a step towards a\n                            constitutional state. Known as the \"March Days\", radical changes began to occur. When the\n                            king refused to add the United Diets into an actual representative institution, the people\n                            began to rebel. On 18 March the king made the decision to agree to some concessions.\n                            However, there were multiple stand-offs with soldiers as he had not been able to stop them\n                            from attacking even peaceful crowds. In March the king agreed to demands issued by the\n                            people and made a number of concessions. At the 22 May 1848, convention he put out the\n                            sketch of the new constitution. The people submitted a revised draft on 26 July 1848. When\n                            all discussions were finished, Frederick dissolved the convention and the constitution was\n                            officially put in place on 5 December 1848</p>\n                        <p>The constitution was separated into 105 different articles headed under eight separate\n                            headings. The nine headings are titled The Territory of the State, The Rights of the\n                            Prussians, The King, The Ministers, The Chambers, The Judicial Power, Public Officials Not\n                            Belonging to the Judicial Class, The Finances and The Communes, Circuits, Districts, and\n                            Provincial Bodies. Each of these groups varies in numbers of articles with the seventh and\n                            ninth sections having only one article each and the second section having forty separate\n                            articles.

At the 1415\n                            Council of Constance Sigismund rewarded Frederick with the Margraviate of Brandenburg and in\n                            1417 he was made a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>\n                        <p>After the Polish wars, the newly established Baltic towns of the German states, including\n                            Prussia, suffered many economic setbacks.[13] Many of the Prussian towns could not even\n                            afford to attend political meetings outside of Prussia. The towns were poverty-stricken,\n                            with even the largest town, Danzig, forced to borrow money from elsewhere to pay for\n                            trade.[13] Poverty in these towns was partly caused by Prussia's neighbours, who had\n                            established and developed such a monopoly on trading that these new towns simply could not\n                            compete. These issues led to feuds, wars, trade competition and invasions.[13] However, the\n                            fall of these towns gave rise to the nobility, separated the east and the west, and allowed\n                            the urban middle class of Brandenburg to prosper.</p>\n                        <p>It was clear in 1440 how different Brandenburg was from the other German territories, as it\n                            faced two dangers that the other German territories did not: partition from within and the\n                            threat of invasion by its neighbours.[3] It prevented partition by enacting the Dispositio\n                            Achillea, which instilled the principle of primogeniture to both the Brandenburg and\n                            Franconian territories.[3] The second issue was resolved through expansion. Brandenburg was\n                            surrounded on every side by neighbours whose boundaries were merely political.[3] Any\n                            neighbour could attack and consume Brandenburg at any moment. The only way to defend herself\n                            was to absorb her neighbours before they absorbed her.[3] Through negotiations and marriages\n                            Brandenburg slowly but surely expanded her borders, absorbing neighbours and eliminating the\n                            threat of attack.</p>\n                        <p>The Hohenzollerns were made rulers of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1518. In 1529 the\n                            Hohenzollerns secured the reversion of the Duchy of Pomerania after a series of conflicts,\n                            and acquired its eastern part following the Peace of Westphalia.</p>\n                        <p>In 1618 the electors of Brandenburg also inherited the Duchy of Prussia, since 1511 ruled by\n                            a younger branch of the House of Hohenzollern. In 1525, Albrecht of Brandenburg, the last\n                            grand master of the Teutonic Order, secularized his territory and converted it into a duchy.\n                            It was ruled in a personal union with Brandenburg, known as \"Brandenburg-Prussia\". A full\n                            union was not possible, since Brandenburg was still legally part of the Holy Roman Empire\n                            and the Duchy of Prussia was a fief of Poland. The Teutonic Order had paid homage to Poland\n                            since 1466, and the Hohenzollerns continued to pay homage after secularizing Ducal Prussia.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>In the course of the Second Northern War, the treaties of Labiau and Wehlau-Bromberg granted\n                            the Hohenzollerns full sovereignty over the Prussian duchy by September 1657.</p>\n                        <p>In return for an alliance against France in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great\n                            Elector's son, Frederick III, was allowed to elevate Prussia to a kingdom in the Crown\n                            Treaty of 16 November 1700. Frederick crowned himself \"King in Prussia\" as Frederick I on 18\n                            January 1701. Legally, no kingdoms could exist in the Holy Roman Empire except for Bohemia.\n                            However, Frederick took the line that since Prussia had never been part of the empire and\n                            the Hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it, he could elevate Prussia to a kingdom.</p>\n                        <p>The style \"King in Prussia\" was adopted to acknowledge the legal fiction that the\n                            Hohenzollerns were legally kings only in their former duchy. In Brandenburg and the portions\n                            of their domains that were within the Empire, they were still legally only electors under\n                            the overlordship of the emperor. However, by this time the emperor's authority was only\n                            nominal. The rulers of the empire's various territories acted largely as the rulers of\n                            sovereign states, and only acknowledged the emperor's suzerainty in a formal way. In\n                            addition, the Duchy was only the eastern half of the region of Prussia; the western half was\n                            held by the King of Poland. While the personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia legally\n                            continued until the end of the empire in 1806, from 1701 onward Brandenburg was de facto\n                            treated as an integral part of the kingdom. Since the Hohenzollerns were nominally still\n                            subjects of the emperor within the parts of their domains that were part of the empire, they\n                            continued to use the additional title of Elector of Brandenburg until the empire was\n                            dissolved. It was not until 1772 that the title was changed to \"King of Prussia\".</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>1701–1721: Plague and the Great Northern War</h4>\n                        <p>The Kingdom of Prussia was still recovering from the devastation of the Thirty Years' War and\n                            poor in natural resources.

In 1708 about one third of the population of the Duchy of Prussia died of\n                            bubonic plague.[14] The plague reached Prenzlau in August 1710 but receded before it could\n                            reach the capital Berlin, which was only 80 km (50 mi) away.</p>\n                        <p>The Great Northern War was the first major conflict in which the Kingdom of Prussia was\n                            involved. Starting in 1700, the Great Northern War involved a coalition led by Tsarist\n                            Russia against the dominant North European power at the time, the Swedish Empire. Frederick\n                            William in 1705 tried to get Prussia involved in the war, stating it \"best Prussia has her\n                            own army and make her own decisions.\"[15] His views, however, were not considered acceptable\n                            by those in power. It was not until 1713 that Frederick William gained full royal\n                            powers.[15] Therefore, in 1715, Prussia, led by Frederick William, joined the coalition for\n                            various reasons,[15] including the danger of being attacked from both her rear and the sea;\n                            her claims on Pomerania; and the fact that if she stood aside and Sweden lost, she would not\n                            get a share of the territory.[3][15] Prussia only participated in one battle, the Battle of\n                            Stresow on the island of Rügen, as the war had already been practically decided in the 1709\n                            Battle of Poltava. In the Treaty of Stockholm Prussia gained all of Swedish Pomerania east\n                            of the river Oder. Sweden would however keep Vorpommern until 1815. The Great Northern War\n                            not only marked the end of the Swedish Empire but also elevated Prussia and Russia as new\n                            powers in Europe.</p>\n                        <p>The Great Elector had incorporated the Junkers, the landed aristocracy, into the empire's\n                            bureaucracy and military machine, giving them a vested interest in the Prussian Army and\n                            compulsory education.[17] King Frederick William I inaugurated the Prussian compulsory\n                            system in 1717.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>1740–1762: Silesian Wars</h4>\n                        <p>In 1740 King Frederick II (Frederick the Great) came to the throne. Using the pretext of a\n                            1537 treaty (vetoed by Emperor Ferdinand I) by which parts of Silesia were to pass to\n                            Brandenburg after the extinction of its ruling Piast dynasty, Frederick invaded Silesia,\n                            thereby beginning the War of the Austrian Succession. After rapidly occupying Silesia,\n                            Frederick offered to protect Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria if the province were\n                            turned over to him. The offer was rejected, but Austria faced several other opponents, and\n                            Frederick was eventually able to gain formal cession with the Treaty of Berlin in 1742.</p>\n                        <p>To the surprise of many, Austria managed to renew the war successfully. In 1744 Frederick\n                            invaded again to forestall reprisals and to claim, this time, the province of Bohemia. He\n                            failed, but French pressure on Austria's ally Great Britain led to a series of treaties and\n                            compromises, culminating in the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle that restored peace and left\n                            Prussia in possession of most of Silesia.</p>\n                        <p>Humiliated by the cession of Silesia, Austria worked to secure an alliance with France and\n                            Russia (the \"Diplomatic Revolution\"), while Prussia drifted into Great Britain's camp\n                            forming the Anglo-Prussian Alliance. When Frederick preemptively invaded Saxony and Bohemia\n                            over the course of a few months in 1756–1757, he began a Third Silesian War and initiated\n                            the Seven Years' War.</p>\n                        <p>This war was a desperate struggle for the Prussian Army, and the fact that it managed to\n                            fight much of Europe to a draw bears witness to Frederick's military skills. Facing Austria,\n                            Russia, France, and Sweden simultaneously, and with only Hanover (and the non-continental\n                            British) as notable allies, Frederick managed to prevent serious invasion until October\n                            1760, when the Russian army briefly occupied Berlin and Königsberg. The situation became\n                            progressively grimmer, however, until the death in 1762 of Empress Elizabeth of Russia\n                            (Miracle of the House of Brandenburg). The accession of the Prussophile Peter III relieved\n                            the pressure on the eastern front. Sweden also exited the war at about the same time.</p>\n                        <p>Defeating the Austrian army at the Battle of Burkersdorf and relying on continuing British\n                            success against France in the war's colonial theatres, Prussia was finally able to force a\n                            status quo ante bellum on the continent. This result confirmed Prussia's major role within\n                            the German states and established the country as a European great power. Frederick, appalled\n                            by the near-defeat of Prussia, lived out his days as a much more peaceable ruler.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art07\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>1772, 1793, and 1795: Partitions of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</h4>\n                        <p>To the east and south of Prussia, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had gradually weakened\n                            during the 18th century. Alarmed by increasing Russian influences in Polish affairs and by a\n                            possible expansion of the Russian Empire, Frederick was instrumental in initiating the first\n                            of the Partitions of Poland between Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1772 to maintain a\n                            balance of power.[citation needed] The Kingdom of Prussia annexed most of the Polish\n                            province of Royal Prussia, including Warmia; the annexed land was organised the following\n                            year into the Province of West Prussia.

To this end, Hanover (including Bremen-Verden) also had to provide\n                            troops for the so-called demarcation army maintaining this state of armed neutrality.</p>\n                        <p>In the course of the War of the Second Coalition against France (1799–1802) Napoleon\n                            Bonaparte urged Prussia to occupy the continental British dominions. In 1801, twenty-four\n                            thousand Prussian soldiers invaded, surprising Hanover, which surrendered without a fight.\n                            In April 1801 the Prussian troops arrived in Bremen-Verden's capital Stade and stayed there\n                            until October of the same year. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland first\n                            ignored Prussia's hostility, but when it joined the pro-French coalition of armed \"neutral\"\n                            powers such as Denmark–Norway and Russia, Britain started to capture Prussian sea vessels.\n                            After the battle of Copenhagen the coalition fell apart and Prussia again withdrew its\n                            troops.</p>\n                        <p>At Napoleon's instigation, Prussia recaptured British Hanover and Bremen-Verden in early\n                            1806. On August 6 of the same year, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved as a result of\n                            Napoleon's victories over Austria. The title of Kurfürst (Prince-elector) of Brandenburg\n                            became meaningless, and was dropped. Nonetheless, Frederick William III was now de jure as\n                            well as de facto sovereign of all of the Hohenzollern domains.[18] Before this time, the\n                            Hohenzollern sovereign had held many titles and crowns, from Supreme Governor of the\n                            Protestant Churches (summus episcopus) to King, Elector, Grand Duke, Duke for the various\n                            regions and realms under his rule. After 1806 he was simply King of Prussia and summus\n                            episcopus.</p>\n                        <p>But when Prussia, after it turned against the French Empire, was defeated in the Battle of\n                            Jena–Auerstedt (October 14, 1806), Frederick William III was forced to temporarily flee to\n                            remote Memel.[19] After the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, Prussia lost about half of its\n                            territory, including the land gained from the Second and Third Partitions of Poland (which\n                            now fell to the Duchy of Warsaw) and all land west of the Elbe River. France recaptured\n                            Prussian-occupied Hanover, including Bremen-Verden. The remainder of the kingdom was\n                            occupied by French troops (at Prussia's expense) and the king was obliged to make an\n                            alliance with France and join the Continental System.</p>\n                        <p>The Prussian reforms were a reaction to the Prussian defeat in 1806 and the Treaties of\n                            Tilsit.

Notable exceptions included much of the territory annexed in\n                            the Second and Third Partitions of Poland, which became Congress Poland under Russian rule\n                            (though it did retain Danzig, acquired in the Second Partition). It also did not regain\n                            several of its former towns in the south. However, as compensation it picked up some new\n                            territory, including 40% of the Kingdom of Saxony and much of Westphalia and the Rhineland.\n                            Prussia now stretched uninterrupted from the Niemen in the east to the Elbe in the west, and\n                            possessed a chain of disconnected territories west of the Elbe. This left Prussia as the\n                            only great power with a predominantly German-speaking population.</p>\n                        <p>With these gains in territory, the kingdom was reorganised into 10 provinces.

Those advocating for Prussian leadership contended that Austria had\n                            far too many non-German interests to work for the greater good of Germany. They argued that\n                            Prussia, as by far the most powerful state with a majority of German-speakers, was best\n                            suited to lead the new nation.</p>\n                        <p>The establishment of the German Customs Union (Zollverein) in 1834, which excluded Austria,\n                            increased Prussian influence over the member states.

Frederick William refused the offer on the grounds that revolutionary\n                            assemblies could not grant royal titles. But he also refused for two other reasons: to do so\n                            would have done little to end the internal power-struggle between Austria and Prussia, and\n                            all Prussian kings (up to and including William I) feared that the formation of a German\n                            Empire would mean the end of Prussia's independence within the German states.</p>\n                        <p>In 1848 actions taken by Denmark towards the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein led to the\n                            First War of Schleswig (1848–51) between Denmark and the German Confederation, resulting in\n                            a Danish victory.</p>\n                        <p>Frederick William issued Prussia's first constitution by his own authority in 1848. This\n                            document—moderate by the standards of the time but conservative by today's\n                            standards—provided for a two-chamber parliament, the Landtag. The lower house, later known\n                            as the Abgeordnetenhaus, was elected by all taxpayers, who were divided into three classes\n                            whose votes were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid. Women and those who paid no\n                            taxes had no vote. This allowed just over one-third of the voters to choose 85% of the\n                            legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do men of the population. The\n                            upper house, later renamed the Herrenhaus (\"House of Lords\"), was appointed by the king. He\n                            retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result,\n                            the grip of the landowning classes, the Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the\n                            eastern provinces.</p>\n                        <p>Frederick William suffered a stroke in 1857, and his younger brother, Prince William, became\n                            regent. William pursued a considerably more moderate policy. Upon Frederick William IV's\n                            death in 1861 he succeeded to the Prussian throne as William I. However, shortly after\n                            becoming king, he faced a dispute with his parliament over the size of the army. The\n                            parliament, dominated by the liberals, balked at William's desire to increase the number of\n                            regiments and withheld approval of the budget to pay for its cost. A deadlock ensued, and\n                            William seriously considered abdicating in favour of his son, Crown Prince Frederick\n                            William. Ultimately, he decided to appoint as prime minister Otto von Bismarck, at that time\n                            the Prussian ambassador to France. Bismarck took office on September 23, 1862.</p>\n                        <p>Although Bismarck had a reputation as an unyielding conservative, he initially inclined to\n                            seek a compromise over the budget issue. However, William refused to consider it; he viewed\n                            defence issues as the crown's personal province. Forced into a policy of confrontation,\n                            Bismarck came up with a novel theory. Under the constitution, the king and the parliament\n                            were responsible for agreeing on the budget. Bismarck argued that since they had failed to\n                            come to an agreement, there was a \"hole\" in the constitution, and the government had to\n                            continue to collect taxes and disburse funds in accordance with the old budget in order to\n                            keep functioning. The government thus operated without a new budget from 1862 to 1866,\n                            allowing Bismarck to implement William's military reforms.</p>\n                        <p>The liberals violently denounced Bismarck for what they saw as his disregard for the\n                            fundamental law of the kingdom. However, Bismarck's real plan was an accommodation with\n                            liberalism. Although he had opposed German unification earlier in his career, he had now\n                            come to believe it inevitable. To his mind, the conservative forces had to take the lead in\n                            the drive toward creating a unified nation in order to keep from being eclipsed. He also\n                            believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they wanted to\n                            break the grip of the traditional forces over society. He thus embarked on a drive to form a\n                            united Germany under Prussian leadership, and guided Prussia through three wars which\n                            ultimately achieved this goal.</p>\n                        <p>The first of these wars was the Second War of Schleswig (1864), which Prussia initiated and\n                            succeeded in, and in which it gained the assistance of Austria. Denmark was soundly defeated\n                            and surrendered both Schleswig and Holstein, to Prussia and Austria respectively.</p>\n                        <p>The divided administration of Schleswig and Holstein then became the trigger for the\n                            Austro-Prussian War of 1866—also known as the Seven Weeks' War. Prussia, allied with the\n                            Kingdom of Italy and various northern German states, declared war on the Austrian Empire.\n                            The Austrian-led coalition was crushed, and Prussia annexed four of its smaller allies—the\n                            Kingdom of Hanover, the Electorate of Hesse, the Duchy of Nassau and the Free City of\n                            Frankfurt. Prussia also annexed Schleswig and Holstein, and also effectively annexed\n                            Saxe-Lauenburg by forcing it into a personal union with Prussia (which was turned into a\n                            full union in 1876). King William initially wanted to take territory from Austria itself,\n                            but Bismarck persuaded him to abandon the idea. While Bismarck wanted Austria to play no\n                            future role in German affairs, he foresaw that Austria could be a valuable future ally.</p>\n                        <p>With these gains in territory, the Prussian possessions in the Rhineland and Westphalia\n                            became geographically connected to the rest of the kingdom for the first time. Counting the\n                            de facto annexation of Saxe-Lauenburg, Prussia now stretched uninterrupted across the\n                            northern two-thirds of Germany. It would remain at this size until the overthrow of the\n                            monarchy in 1918.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck used this opportunity to end the budget dispute with parliament. He proposed a bill\n                            of indemnity granting him retroactive approval for governing without a legal budget. He\n                            guessed, correctly as it turned out, that this would lead to a split between his liberal\n                            adversaries. While some of them argued that there could be no compromise with the principle\n                            of constitutional government, most of the liberals decided to support the bill in hopes of\n                            winning more freedom in the future.</p>\n                        <p>The German Confederation was dissolved as part of the war.[citation needed] In its place,\n                            Prussia cajoled the 21 states north of the Main into forming the North German Confederation\n                            in 1867. Prussia was the dominant state in this new grouping, with four-fifths of its\n                            territory and population—more than the other members of the confederation combined. Its\n                            near-total control was cemented in a constitution written by Bismarck. Executive power was\n                            vested in a president—a hereditary office of the rulers of Prussia. He was assisted by a\n                            chancellor responsible only to the president. There was also a bicameral parliament. The\n                            lower house, or Reichstag (Diet), was elected by universal male suffrage. The upper house,\n                            or Bundesrat (Federal Council) was appointed by the state governments. The Bundesrat was, in\n                            practice, the stronger chamber. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes and could easily control\n                            proceedings through alliances with the other states. For all intents and purposes, Bismarck\n                            dominated the new grouping. He served as his own foreign minister for virtually his entire\n                            tenure as prime minister of Prussia, and in that capacity was able to instruct the Prussian\n                            delegates to the Bundesrat.</p>\n                        <p>The southern German states (except Austria) were forced[by whom?] to accept military\n                            alliances with Prussia, and Prussia began steps to merge them with the North German\n                            Confederation. Bismarck's planned Kleindeutschland unification of Germany had come\n                            considerably closer to realisation.</p>\n                        <p>The final act came with the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), where Bismarck maneuvered\n                            Emperor Napoleon III of France into declaring war on Prussia. Activating the German\n                            alliances put in place after the Austro-Prussian War, the German states, aside from Austria,\n                            came together and swiftly defeated France, even managing to take Napoleon prisoner (2\n                            September 1870). Even before then,[citation needed] Bismarck was able to complete the work\n                            of unifying Germany under Prussian leadership. The patriotic fervour aroused by the war\n                            against France overwhelmed the remaining opponents of a unified Kleindeutschland nation, and\n                            on 18 January 1871 (the 170th anniversary of the coronation of the first Prussian king,\n                            Frederick I), the German Empire was proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles[22]\n                            outside of Paris, while the French capital was still under siege. King William became the\n                            first emperor (Kaiser) of a unified Germany.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art11\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>1871–1918: Peak and fall</h4>\n                        <p>Bismarck's new empire was the most powerful state on the Continent. Prussia's dominance over\n                            the new empire was almost as absolute as it was with the North German Confederation. It\n                            included two-thirds of the empire's territory and three-fifths of its population. The\n                            imperial crown was a hereditary office of the House of Hohenzollern. Prussia also had a\n                            large plurality of seats in the Bundesrat, with 17 votes out of 58 (17 out of 61 after\n                            1911); no other state had more than six votes. As before, it could effectively control the\n                            proceedings with the support of its allies in the secondary states. As mentioned above,\n                            Bismarck served as foreign minister of Prussia for almost his entire career, and in that\n                            role instructed the Prussian deputies to the Bundesrat. The Imperial Army was essentially an\n                            enlarged Prussian army, and the embassies of the new empire were mostly old Prussian\n                            embassies. The constitution of the German Empire was essentially an amended version of the\n                            constitution of the North German Confederation.</p>\n                        <p>However, the seeds for future problems lay in a gross disparity between the imperial and\n                            Prussian systems. The empire granted the vote to all men over 25. However, Prussia retained\n                            its restrictive three-class voting system, in which the well-to-do had 17½ times the voting\n                            power of the rest of the population. Since the imperial chancellor was, except for two\n                            periods (January–November 1873 and 1892–94) also prime minister of Prussia, this meant that\n                            for most of the empire's existence, the king/emperor and prime minister/chancellor had to\n                            seek majorities from legislatures elected by two completely different franchises.</p>\n                        <p>At the time of the empire's creation, both Prussia and Germany were roughly two-thirds rural.\n                            Within 20 years, the situation was reversed; the cities and towns accounted for two-thirds\n                            of the population. However, in both the kingdom and the empire, the constituencies were\n                            never redrawn to reflect the growing population and influence of the cities and towns. This\n                            meant that rural areas were grossly overrepresented from the 1890s onward.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck realised that the rest of Europe was skeptical of his powerful new Reich, and turned\n                            his attention to preserving peace with such acts as the Congress of Berlin. The new German\n                            Empire improved its already-strong relations with Britain. The ties between London and\n                            Berlin had already been sealed with a golden braid in 1858, when Crown Prince Frederick\n                            William of Prussia married Princess Victoria of Britain.</p>\n                        <p>William I died in 1888, and the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as Frederick III. The\n                            new emperor, a decided Anglophile, planned to transform Prussia and the empire into a more\n                            liberal and democratic monarchy based on the British model. However, Frederick was already\n                            ill with inoperable throat cancer, and died after only 99 days on the throne. He was\n                            succeeded by his 29-year-old son, William II. As a boy, William had rebelled against his\n                            parents' efforts to mould him as a liberal, and had become thoroughly Prussianized under\n                            Bismarck's tutelage.</p>\n                        <p>The new Kaiser Wiliam rapidly soured relations with the British and Russian royal families\n                            (despite being closely related to them), becoming their rival and ultimately their enemy.\n                            Before and during World War I (1914–1918), Prussia supplied significant numbers of soldiers\n                            and sailors in the German military, and Prussian Junkers dominated the higher ranks. In\n                            addition, portions of the Eastern Front were fought on Prussian soil. Prussia – along with\n                            Germany as a whole – experienced increasing troubles with revolutionaries during the war.\n                            The Great War ended by armistice on 11 November 1918.</p>\n                        <p>Uprisings in Berlin and other centres began the civil conflict of the German Revolution of\n                            1918–19 (German: Novemberrevolution). By late 1918, the Prussian House of Representatives\n                            was controlled by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which advocated Marxism.\n                            William knew that he had lost his imperial crown for good, but still hoped to retain his\n                            Prussian crown; he believed that as ruler of two-thirds of Germany, he could remain a major\n                            figure in any successor regime. However, William discovered this was impossible under the\n                            imperial constitution. Although he believed he ruled the empire in personal union with\n                            Prussia, the imperial constitution stipulated that the imperial crown was tied to the\n                            Prussian crown. In any event, he had lost support of the military who might have fought for\n                            him. William's abdication as both king of Prussia and German emperor was announced on 9\n                            November 1918, and he went into exile in the Netherlands the next day. With armed revolts,\n                            mass strikes, and street fighting in Berlin, the Prussian state government declared a state\n                            of siege and appealed for imperial military aid. The Garde-Kavallerie-Schützen-Division,\n                            commanded by Waldemar Pabst, moved against the strikers in Berlin.

The German revolutions of 1848–49,\n                        motivated by liberal, democratic, socialist and nationalist sentiments, attempted to transform\n                        the Confederation into a unified German federal state with a liberal constitution (usually\n                        called the Frankfurt Constitution in English). The ruling body of the Confederation, the\n                        Confederate Diet, was dissolved on 12 July 1848, but was re-established in 1850 after the\n                        revolution was crushed by Austria, Prussia and other states.</p>\n                    <p>The Confederation was finally dissolved after the victory of the Kingdom of Prussia in the Seven\n                        Weeks' War over the Austrian Empire in 1866. The dispute over which had the inherent right to\n                        rule German lands ended in favour of Prussia, leading to the creation of the North German\n                        Confederation under Prussian leadership in 1867, to which the eastern portions of the Kingdom of\n                        Prussia were added. A number of South German states remained independent until they joined the\n                        North German Confederation, which was renamed and proclaimed as the \"German Empire\" in 1871, as\n                        the unified Germany (aside from Austria) with the Prussian king as emperor (Kaiser) after the\n                        victory over French Emperor Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.</p>\n                    <p>Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective, as well as an\n                        obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state.[4] This weakness was part of its design, as\n                        the European Great Powers, including Prussia and especially Austria, did not want it to become a\n                        nation-state. However, the Confederation was not a 'loose' tie between the German states, as it\n                        was impossible to leave the Confederation, and as Confederation law stood above the law of the\n                        aligned states. The constitutional weakness of the Confederation lay in the principle of\n                        unanimity in the Diet and the limits of the Confederation's scope: it was essentially a military\n                        alliance to defend Germany against external attacks and internal riots. Ironically, the war of\n                        1866 proved its ineffectiveness, as it was unable to combine the federal troops in order to\n                        fight the Prussian secession.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Population</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Demographic transition</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Nobility</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Peasantry</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Rapidly growing cities</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Demographic transition</h4>\n                        <p>The population of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew 60% from 1815 to 1865,\n                            from 21,000,000 to 34,000,000.[12] The era saw the demographic transition take place in\n                            Germany. It was a transition from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth and\n                            death rates[citation needed] as the country developed from a pre-industrial to a modernized\n                            agriculture and supported a fast-growing industrialized urban economic system. In previous\n                            centuries, the shortage of land meant that not everyone could marry, and marriages took\n                            place after age 25. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality,\n                            plus periodic epidemics and harvest failures. After 1815, increased agricultural\n                            productivity meant a larger food supply, and a decline in famines, epidemics, and\n                            malnutrition. This allowed couples to marry earlier, and have more children. Arranged\n                            marriages became uncommon as young people were now allowed to choose their own marriage\n                            partners, subject to a veto by the parents. The upper and middle classes began to practice\n                            birth control, and a little later so too did the peasants.[13] The population in 1800 was\n                            heavily rural,[14] with only 8% of the people living in communities of 5,000 to 100,000 and\n                            another 2% living in cities of more than 100,000.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Nobility</h4>\n                        <p>In a heavily agrarian society, land ownership played a central role. Germany's nobles,\n                            especially those in the East called Junkers, dominated not only the localities, but also the\n                            Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized\n                            Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of\n                            control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. They retained control of the judicial\n                            system on their estates until 1848, as well as control of hunting and game laws. They paid\n                            no land tax until 1861 and kept their police authority until 1872, and controlled church\n                            affairs into the early 20th century. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up\n                            a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to\n                            peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the nobility controlled\n                            the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental\n                            policies.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Peasantry</h4>\n                        <p>Peasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a\n                            corporate body and helped manage community resources and monitor community life. In the\n                            East, they were serfs who were bound prominently to parcels of land. In most of Germany,\n                            farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the\n                            landlord, who was typically a nobleman.[17] Peasant leaders supervised the fields and\n                            ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village\n                            court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family, the patriarch made all the decisions\n                            and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal\n                            life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to\n                            choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and\n                            politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily\n                            activities or decisions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Rapidly growing cities</h4>\n                        <p>After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due primarily to the influx of young people\n                            from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 people in 1800 to 826,000 in 1870; Hamburg\n                            grew from 130,000 to 290,000; Munich from 40,000 to 269,000; Breslau (now Wrocław) from\n                            60,000 to 208,000; Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000; Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) from 55,000\n                            to 112,000. Offsetting this growth, there was extensive emigration, especially to the United\n                            States. Emigration totaled 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and 780,000 in the\n                            1860s.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn05\" disabled=\"\">Background</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn06\">Establishment</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn07\">Situation in history</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn08\">Impact of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic invasions</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn09\">Romanticism, nationalism, and liberalism in the Vormärz era</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn10\">Zollverein: economic integration</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn11\">Revolutions of 1848</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn12\">Dissolution of the Confederation</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\">\n                        <h4>Background</h4>\n                        <p>The War of the Third Coalition lasted from about 1803 to 1806. Following defeat at the Battle\n                            of Austerlitz by the French under Napoleon in December 1805, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II\n                            abdicated, and the Empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806. The resulting Treaty of Pressburg\n                            established the Confederation of the Rhine in July 1806, joining together sixteen of\n                            France's allies among the German states (including Bavaria and Württemberg). After the\n                            Battle of Jena–Auerstedt of October 1806 in the War of the Fourth Coalition, various other\n                            German states, including Saxony and Westphalia, also joined the Confederation. Only Austria,\n                            Prussia, Danish Holstein, Swedish Pomerania, and the French-occupied Principality of Erfurt\n                            stayed outside the Confederation of the Rhine. The War of the Sixth Coalition from 1812 to\n                            winter 1814 saw the defeat of Napoleon and the liberation of Germany. In June 1814, the\n                            famous German patriot Heinrich vom Stein created the Central Managing Authority for Germany\n                            (Zentralverwaltungsbehörde) in Frankfurt to replace the defunct Confederation of the Rhine.\n                            However, plenipotentiaries gathered at the Congress of Vienna were determined to create a\n                            weaker union of German states than envisaged by Stein.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Establishment</h4>\n                        <p>The German Confederation was created by the 9th Act of the Congress of Vienna on 8 June 1815\n                            after being alluded to in Article 6 of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, ending the War of the Sixth\n                            Coalition.</p>\n                        <p>The Confederation was formally created by a second treaty, the Final Act of the Ministerial\n                            Conference to Complete and Consolidate the Organization of the German Confederation.

In 1867 the duchy was\n                            declared to be an \"integral part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\".

Large parts of both countries were not included in the\n                            Confederation, because they had not been part of the former Holy Roman Empire, nor had the\n                            greater parts of their armed forces been incorporated in the federal army.

It also kept intact most of Confederation's\n                            reconstituted member states and their boundaries. The member states, drastically reduced to\n                            39 from more than 300 (see Kleinstaaterei) under the Holy Roman Empire, were recognized as\n                            fully sovereign. The members pledged themselves to mutual defense, and joint maintenance of\n                            the fortresses at Mainz, the city of Luxembourg, Rastatt, Ulm, and Landau.</p>\n                        <p>The only organ of the Confederation was the Federal Assembly (officially Bundesversammlung,\n                            often called Bundestag), which consisted of the delegates of the states' governments. There\n                            was no head of state, but the Austrian delegate presided over the Assembly (according to the\n                            Bundesakte). Austria did not have extra powers, but consequently the Austrian delegate was\n                            called Präsidialgesandther and Austria the Präsidialmacht (presiding power). The Assembly\n                            met in Frankfurt.</p>\n                        <p>The Confederation was enabled to accept and deploy ambassadors. It allowed ambassadors of the\n                            European powers to the Assembly, but rarely deployed ambassadors itself.</p>\n                        <p>During the revolution of 1848/49 the Federal Assembly was inactive. It transferred its powers\n                            to the Provisorische Zentralgewalt, the revolutionary German Central Government of the\n                            Frankfurt National Assembly. After crushing the revolution and illegally disbanding the\n                            National Assembly, the Prussian King failed to create a German nation state by himself. The\n                            Federal Assembly was revived in 1850 on Austrian initiative, but only fully reinstalled in\n                            the Summer of 1851.</p>\n                        <p>Rivalry between Prussia and Austria grew more and more, especially after 1859. The\n                            Confederation was dissolved in 1866 after the Austro-Prussian War, and was succeeded in 1866\n                            by the Prussian-dominated North German Confederation. Unlike the German Confederation, the\n                            North German Confederation was in fact a true state. Its territory comprised the parts of\n                            the German Confederation north of the river Main, plus Prussia's eastern territories and the\n                            Duchy of Schleswig, but excluded Austria and the other southern German states.</p>\n                        <p>Prussia's influence was widened by the Franco-Prussian War resulting in the proclamation of\n                            the German Empire at Versailles on 18 January 1871, which united the North German Federation\n                            with the southern German states. All the constituent states of the former German\n                            Confederation became part of the Kaiserreich in 1871, except Austria, Luxembourg, the Duchy\n                            of Limburg, and Liechtenstein.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art08\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Impact of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic invasions</h4>\n                        <p>The late 18th century was a period of political, economic, intellectual, and cultural\n                            reforms, the Enlightenment (represented by figures such as Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, and\n                            Adam Smith), but also involving early Romanticism, and climaxing with the French Revolution,\n                            where freedom of the individual and nation was asserted against privilege and custom.\n                            Representing a great variety of types and theories, they were largely a response to the\n                            disintegration of previous cultural patterns, coupled with new patterns of production,\n                            specifically the rise of industrial capitalism.</p>\n                        <p>However, the defeat of Napoleon enabled conservative and reactionary regimes such as those of\n                            the Kingdom of Prussia, the Austrian Empire, and Tsarist Russia to survive, laying the\n                            groundwork for the Congress of Vienna and the alliance that strove to oppose radical demands\n                            for change ushered in by the French Revolution. The Great Powers at the Congress of Vienna\n                            in 1815 aimed to restore Europe (as far as possible) to its pre-war conditions by combating\n                            both liberalism and nationalism and by creating barriers around France. With Austria's\n                            position on the continent now intact and ostensibly secure under its reactionary premier\n                            Klemens von Metternich, the Habsburg empire would serve as a barrier to contain the\n                            emergence of Italian and German nation-states as well, in addition to containing France. But\n                            this reactionary balance of power, aimed at blocking German and Italian nationalism on the\n                            continent, was precarious.</p>\n                        <p>After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, the surviving member states of the defunct Holy Roman\n                            Empire joined to form the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund)—a rather loose organization,\n                            especially because the two great rivals, the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia,\n                            each feared domination by the other.</p>\n                        <p>In Prussia the Hohenzollern rulers forged a centralized state. By the time of the Napoleonic\n                            Wars, Prussia, grounded in the virtues of its established military aristocracy (the Junkers)\n                            and stratified by rigid hierarchical lines, had been surpassed militarily and economically\n                            by France. After 1807, Prussia's defeats by Napoleonic France highlighted the need for\n                            administrative, economic, and social reforms to improve the efficiency of the bureaucracy\n                            and encourage practical merit-based education. Inspired by the Napoleonic organization of\n                            German and Italian principalities, the Prussian Reform Movement led by Karl August von\n                            Hardenberg and Count Stein was conservative, enacted to preserve aristocratic privilege\n                            while modernizing institutions.</p>\n                        <p>Outside Prussia, industrialization progressed slowly, and was held back because of political\n                            disunity, conflicts of interest between the nobility and merchants, and the continued\n                            existence of the guild system, which discouraged competition and innovation. While this kept\n                            the middle class at bay, affording the old order a measure of stability not seen in France,\n                            Prussia's vulnerability to Napoleon's military proved to many among the old order that a\n                            fragile, divided, and traditionalist Germany would be easy prey for its cohesive and\n                            industrializing neighbor.</p>\n                        <p>The reforms laid the foundation for Prussia's future military might by professionalizing the\n                            military and decreeing universal military conscription. In order to industrialize Prussia,\n                            working within the framework provided by the old aristocratic institutions, land reforms\n                            were enacted to break the monopoly of the Junkers on land ownership, thereby also\n                            abolishing, among other things, the feudal practice of serfdom.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art09\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Romanticism, nationalism, and liberalism in the Vormärz era</h4>\n                        <p>Although the forces unleashed by the French Revolution were seemingly under control after the\n                            Vienna Congress, the conflict between conservative forces and liberal nationalists was only\n                            deferred at best. The era until the failed 1848 revolution, in which these tensions built\n                            up, is commonly referred to as Vormärz (\"pre-March\"), in reference to the outbreak of riots\n                            in March 1848.</p>\n                        <p>This conflict pitted the forces of the old order against those inspired by the French\n                            Revolution and the Rights of Man. The sociological breakdown of the competition was,\n                            roughly, the emerging capitalist bourgeoisie and petit-bourgeoisie (engaged mostly in\n                            commerce, trade, and industry), and the growing (and increasingly radicalized) industrial\n                            working class; and the other side associated with landowning aristocracy or military\n                            aristocracy (the Junkers) in Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy in Austria, and the conservative\n                            notables of the small princely states and city-states in Germany.</p>\n                        <p>Meanwhile, demands for change from below had been fomenting due to the influence of the\n                            French Revolution. Throughout the German Confederation, Austrian influence was paramount,\n                            drawing the ire of the nationalist movements. Metternich considered nationalism, especially\n                            the nationalist youth movement, the most pressing danger: German nationalism might not only\n                            repudiate Austrian dominance of the Confederation, but also stimulate nationalist sentiment\n                            within the Austrian Empire itself. In a multi-national polyglot state in which Slavs and\n                            Magyars outnumbered the Germans, the prospects of Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Serb, or\n                            Croatian sentiment along with middle class liberalism was certainly horrifying to the\n                            monarchist landed aristocracy.</p>\n                        <p>Figures like August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, Ludwig Uhland, Georg Herwegh,\n                            Heinrich Heine, Georg Büchner, Ludwig Börne, and Bettina von Arnim rose in the Vormärz era.\n                            Father Friedrich Jahn's gymnastic associations exposed middle class German youth to\n                            nationalist and democratic ideas, which took the form of the nationalistic and liberal\n                            democratic college fraternities known as the Burschenschaften. The Wartburg Festival in 1817\n                            celebrated Martin Luther as a proto-German nationalist, linking Lutheranism to German\n                            nationalism, and helping arouse religious sentiments for the cause of German nationhood. The\n                            festival culminated in the burning of several books and other items that symbolized\n                            reactionary attitudes. One item was a book by August von Kotzebue. In 1819, Kotzebue was\n                            accused of spying for Russia, and then murdered by a theological student, Karl Ludwig Sand,\n                            who was executed for the crime. Sand belonged to a militant nationalist faction of the\n                            Burschenschaften. Metternich used the murder as a pretext to issue the Carlsbad Decrees of\n                            1819, which dissolved the Burschenschaften, cracked down on the liberal press, and seriously\n                            restricted academic freedom.</p>\n                        <h5>High Culture</h5>\n                        <p>German artists and intellectuals, heavily influenced by the French Revolution, turned to\n                            Romanticism. At the universities, high-powered professors developed international\n                            reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new\n                            historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language,\n                            and literature. With Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) in philosophy, Friedrich\n                            Schleiermacher (1768–1834) in theology and Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886) in history, the\n                            University of Berlin, founded in 1810, became the world's leading university. Von Ranke, for\n                            example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the\n                            1830s, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science,\n                            led by Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) in natural science and Carl Friedrich Gauss\n                            (1777–1855) in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to politics, but their support\n                            for the failed Revolution of 1848 forced many into exile.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art10\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Zollverein: economic integration</h4>\n                        <p>Further efforts to improve the confederation began in 1834 with the establishment of a\n                            customs union, the Zollverein.

Historians have seen three Prussian goals: as a\n                            political tool to eliminate Austrian influence in Germany; as a way to improve the\n                            economies; and to strengthen Germany against potential French aggression while reducing the\n                            economic independence of smaller states.</p>\n                        <p>Inadvertently, these reforms sparked the unification movement and augmented a middle class\n                            demanding further political rights, but at the time backwardness and Prussia's fears of its\n                            stronger neighbors were greater concerns. The customs union opened up a common market, ended\n                            tariffs between states, and standardized weights, measures, and currencies within member\n                            states (excluding Austria), forming the basis of a proto-national economy.</p>\n                        <p>By 1842 the Zollverein included most German states. Within the next twenty years the output\n                            of German furnaces increased fourfold. Coal production grew rapidly as well. In turn, German\n                            industry (especially the works established by the Krupp family) introduced the steel gun,\n                            cast-steel axle, and a breech-loading rifle, exemplifying Germany's successful application\n                            of technology to weaponry. Germany's security was greatly enhanced, leaving the Prussian\n                            state and the landowning aristocracy secure from outside threat. German manufacturers also\n                            produced heavily for the civilian sector. No longer would Britain supply half of Germany's\n                            needs for manufactured goods, as it did beforehand.[23] However, by developing a strong\n                            industrial base, the Prussian state strengthened the middle class and thus the nationalist\n                            movement. Economic integration, especially increased national consciousness among the German\n                            states, made political unity a far likelier scenario. Germany finally began exhibiting all\n                            the features of a proto-nation.</p>\n                        <p>The crucial factor enabling Prussia's conservative regime to survive the Vormärz era was a\n                            rough coalition between leading sectors of the landed upper class and the emerging\n                            commercial and manufacturing interests. Marx and Engels, in their analysis of the abortive\n                            1848 Revolutions, defined such a coalition: \"a commercial and industrial class which is too\n                            weak and dependent to take power and rule in its own right and which therefore throws itself\n                            into the arms of the landed aristocracy and the royal bureaucracy, exchanging the right to\n                            rule for the right to make money.\"[24] Even if the commercial and industrial element is\n                            weak, it must be strong enough (or soon become strong enough) to become worthy of\n                            co-optation, and the French Revolution terrified enough perceptive elements of Prussia's\n                            Junkers for the state to be sufficiently accommodating.</p>\n                        <p>While relative stability was maintained until 1848, with enough bourgeois elements still\n                            content to exchange the \"right to rule for the right to make money\", the landed upper class\n                            found its economic base sinking. While the Zollverein brought economic progress and helped\n                            to keep the bourgeoisie at bay for a while, it increased the ranks of the middle class\n                            swiftly—the very social base for the nationalism and liberalism that the Prussian state\n                            sought to stem.</p>\n                        <p>The Zollverein was a move toward economic integration, modern industrial capitalism, and the\n                            victory of centralism over localism, quickly bringing to an end the era of guilds in the\n                            small German princely states. This led to the 1844 revolt of the Silesian Weavers, who saw\n                            their livelihood destroyed by the flood of new manufactures.</p>\n                        <p>The Zollverein also weakened Austrian domination of the Confederation as economic unity\n                            increased the desire for political unity and nationalism.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art11\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Revolutions of 1848</h4>\n                        <p>News of the 1848 Revolution in Paris quickly reached discontented bourgeois liberals,\n                            republicans and more radical working-men. The first revolutionary uprisings in Germany began\n                            in the state of Baden in March 1848. Within a few days, there were revolutionary uprisings\n                            in other states including Austria, and finally in Prussia. On 15 March 1848, the subjects of\n                            Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia vented their long-repressed political aspirations in violent\n                            rioting in Berlin, while barricades were erected in the streets of Paris. King\n                            Louis-Philippe of France fled to Great Britain. Friedrich Wilhelm gave in to the popular\n                            fury, and promised a constitution, a parliament, and support for German unification,\n                            safeguarding his own rule and regime.</p>\n                        <p>On 18 May, the Frankfurt Parliament (Frankfurt Assembly) opened its first session, with\n                            delegates from various German states. It was immediately divided between those favoring a\n                            kleindeutsche (small German) or grossdeutsche (greater German) solution. The former favored\n                            offering the imperial crown to Prussia. The latter favored the Habsburg crown in Vienna,\n                            which would integrate Austria proper and Bohemia (but not Hungary) into the new Germany.</p>\n                        <p>From May to December, the Assembly eloquently (and leisurely) debated academic topics while\n                            conservatives swiftly moved against the reformers. As in Austria and Russia, this\n                            middle-class assertion increased authoritarian and reactionary sentiments among the landed\n                            upper class, whose economic position was declining. They turned to political levers to\n                            preserve their rule. As the Prussian army proved loyal, and the peasants were uninterested,\n                            Friedrich Wilhelm regained his confidence. The Assembly belatedly issued its Declaration of\n                            the Rights of the German People; a constitution was drawn up (excluding Austria, which\n                            openly rejected the Assembly), and the leadership of the Reich was offered to Friedrich\n                            Wilhelm, who refused to \"pick up a crown from the gutter\". As the monarchist forces marched\n                            their armies to crush rebellions in cities and towns throughout Austria and Germany the\n                            Frankfurt Assembly was forced to flee, first to Stuttgart and then to Württemberg, where,\n                            reduced to so few deputies that it could no longer form a quorum, its final meeting was\n                            forcibly dispersed on 18 June 1849 by the Württemberg army. With the complete triumph of\n                            monarchist reaction rampaging across all of Europe, thousands of German middle class\n                            liberals and \"red\" Forty-eighters were forced to flee into exile (primarily to the United\n                            States, the United Kingdom and Australia).</p>\n                        <p>In 1849, Friedrich Wilhelm proposed his own constitution. His document concentrated real\n                            power in the hands of the King and the upper classes, and called for a confederation of\n                            North German states—the Erfurt Union. Austria and Russia, fearing a strong,\n                            Prussian-dominated Germany, responded by pressuring Saxony and Hanover to withdraw, and\n                            forced Prussia to abandon the scheme in a treaty dubbed the \"humiliation of Olmütz\".</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art12\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Dissolution of the Confederation</h4>\n                        <h5>Rise of Bismarck</h5>\n                        <p>A new generation of statesmen responded to popular demands for national unity for their own\n                            ends, continuing Prussia's tradition of autocracy and reform from above. Germany found an\n                            able leader to accomplish the seemingly paradoxical task of conservative modernization. In\n                            1851, Bismarck was appointed by King Wilhelm I of Prussia (the future Kaiser Wilhelm I) to\n                            circumvent the liberals in the Landtag of Prussia, who resisted Wilhelm's autocratic\n                            militarism. Bismarck told the Diet, \"The great questions of the day are not decided by\n                            speeches and majority votes ... but by blood and iron\" — that is, by warfare and industrial\n                            might.[27] Prussia already had a great army; it was now augmented by rapid growth of\n                            economic power.</p>\n                        <p>Gradually, Bismarck subdued the more restive elements of the middle class with a combination\n                            of threats and reforms, reacting to the revolutionary sentiments expressed in 1848 by\n                            providing them with the economic opportunities for which the urban middle sectors had been\n                            fighting.</p>\n                        <h5>Seven Weeks' War</h5>\n                        <p>The German Confederation ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 between\n                            Austrian Empire and its allies on one side and the Kingdom of Prussia and its allies on the\n                            other. The Confederation had 33 members immediately before its dissolution. In the Prague\n                            peace treaty, on 23 August 1866, Austria had to accept that the Confederation was\n                            dissolved.[29] The following day, the remaining member states confirmed the dissolution. The\n                            treaty allowed Prussia to create a new Bundesverhältnis (a new kind of federation) in the\n                            North of Germany. The South German states were allowed to create a South German\n                            Confederation but this did not come into existence.</p>\n                        <h5>North German Confederation</h5>\n                        <p>Prussia created the North German Confederation in 1867 covering all German states north of\n                            the river Main and also the Hohenzollern territories in Swabia. Besides Austria, the South\n                            German states Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, and Hesse-Darmstadt remained separate from the\n                            rest of Germany. However, due to the successful prosecution of the Franco-Prussian War, the\n                            four southern states joined the North German Confederation by treaty in November 1870.</p>\n                        <h5>German Empire</h5>\n                        <p>As the Franco-Prussian War drew to a close, King Ludwig II of Bavaria was persuaded to ask\n                            King Wilhelm to assume the crown of the new German Empire. On 1 January 1871, the Empire was\n                            declared by the presiding princes and generals in the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of\n                            Versailles, near Paris. The Diet of the North German Confederation moved to rename the North\n                            German Confederation as the German Empire and gave the title of German Emperor to the King\n                            of Prussia.[31] The new constitution of the state, the Constitution of the German\n                            Confederation, effectively transformed the Diet of the Confederation into the German\n                            Parliament (Reichstag).</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">German Confederation</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Deutscher Bund</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">1815–1866</h2>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_year\">Germany: 1815–1866</h3>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_gerconf.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of German Confederation</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>Frankfurt</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">German Confederation</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">Population</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec03\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td>630,100 km<sup>2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td>UTC+1</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_gerconf.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map of German Confederation</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td>29,200,000</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td><ul>\n                            <li>Protestantism</li>\n                            <li>Roman Catholic</li>\n                        </ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Languages</th>\n                        <td><ul>\n                            <li>German</li>\n                            <li>Italian</li>\n                            <li>Low German</li>\n                            <li>Czech</li>\n                            <li>Slovene</li>\n                            <li>Polish</li>\n                        </ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Reichsthaler (to 1857)</li>\n                                <li>Conventionsthaler (to 1857)</li>\n                                <li>Vereinsthaler (from 1857)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>Federal Convention</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Heads of the state</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Francis I (1815–1835)</li>\n                                <li>Ferdinand I (1835–1848)</li>\n                                <li>Franz Joseph I (1850–1866)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n            </div>\n        "},

The Confederation came into existence after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 over the lordship of two small danish duchies (Schleswig-Holstein) claimed by Prussia in 1866. Although de jure a confederacy of equal states, the Confederation was de facto controlled and led by the largest and most powerful member, Prussia, which exercised its influence to bring about the formation of the German Empire. Some historians also use the name for the alliance of 22 German states formed on 18 August 1866 (Augustbündnis).</p>\n                    <p>The growing power of Prussia was worrying other great powers, especially France, French Emperor Napoleon III and his regime, the Second French Empire. In 1868, Spain overthrew queen Isabella II, and a German prince was a candidate for her throne. France, not wanting to be encircled by a German-Spanish alliance, declared war on the Confederation. In 1870–1871, the south German states of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Württemberg and Bavaria joined the country. On 1 January 1871, the country adopted a new constitution, which was written under the title of a new \"German Confederation\" but already gave it the name \"German Empire\" in the preamble and article 11.</p>\n                    <p>The constitution established a constitutional monarchy with the Prussian king as the bearer of the Bundespräsidium, or head of state. Laws could only be enabled with the consent of the Reichstag (a parliament based on universal male suffrage) and the Federal Council (a representation of the states). During the four years of the Confederation, a conservative-liberal cooperation undertook important steps to unify (Northern) Germany with regard to law and infrastructure. The political system (and the political parties) remained essentially the same in the years after 1870.</p>\n                    <p>The Confederation had nearly 30 million inhabitants, of whom eighty percent lived in Prussia.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Political system</h3>\n                    <p>The North German Constitution of 16 April 1867 created a national parliament with universal suffrage (for men above the age of 25), the Reichstag. Another important organ was the Bundesrat, the 'federal council' of the representatives of the allied governments. To adopt a law, a majority in the Reichstag and in the Bundesrat was necessary. This gave the allied governments, meaning the states and their princes, an important veto.</p>\n                    <p>Executive power was vested in a president, a hereditary office of the House of Hohenzollern, the ruling family of Prussia. He was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him – an office that Bismarck designed with himself in mind. There was no formal cabinet; the heads of the departments were not called ministers but secretaries. Those were installed and dismissed by the chancellor.</p>\n                    <p>For all intents and purposes, the confederation was dominated by Prussia. It had four-fifths of the confederation's territory and population – more than the other 21 members combined. The presidency was a hereditary office of the Prussian crown. Bismarck was also foreign minister of Prussia, a post he held for virtually his entire career. In that role he instructed the Prussian deputies to the Bundesrat. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes in the Bundesrat despite being by far the largest state, but could easily get a majority by making alliances with the smaller states.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Prussia's plans to unify Germany</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Aftermath of the 1866 war</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Towards a federal constitution</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Customs Union</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn05\">Transition to the German Empire (1870–71)</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Prussia's plans to unify Germany</h4>\n                        <p>For most of 1815–1848, Austria and Prussia worked together and used the German Confederation as a tool to suppress liberal and national ambitions in the German population. In 1849, the National Assembly in Frankfurt elected the Prussian king as the Emperor of a Lesser Germany (a Germany without Austria). The king refused and tried to unite Germany with the Erfurt Union of 1849–1850. When the union parliament met in early 1850 to discuss the constitution, the participating states were mainly only those in Northern and Central Germany. Austria and the southern German states Württemberg and Bavaria forced Prussia to give up its union plans in late 1850.</p>\n                        <p>In April and June 1866, Prussia proposed a Lesser Germany again. Corner stone of the proposal was the election of a German parliament based on universal male suffrage.[3] The proposal even explicitly mentioned the Frankfurt election law of 1849. Otto von Bismarck, the minister-president of Prussia, wanted to gain sympathy within the national and liberal movement of the time. Austria and its allies refused the proposal. In summer 1866 Austria and Prussia fought with their respective allies in the Austro-Prussian War.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Aftermath of the 1866 war</h4>\n                        <p>Prussia and Austria signed a Nikolsburg preliminary (26 July) and a final peace treaty of Prague (23 August). Austria affirmed the Prussian view that the German Confederation was dissolved. Prussia was allowed to create a \"closer federation\" (einen engeren Bund) in Germany north of the river Main. Bismarck had already agreed on this limitation with the French emperor Napoleon III prior to the peace talks.</p>\n                        <p>The liberals in the Prussian parliament favored a wholesale annexation of all North German territories by Prussia. In a similar way, Sardinia–Piemont had created the kingdom of Italy. But Bismarck chose a different approach. Prussia incorporated (in October 1866) only the former military opponents Hannover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, the free city of Frankfurt and the Hesse-Homburg area of Hesse Darmstadt. These areas were combined into the two new Prussian provinces of Hannover and Hesse-Nassau. Schleswig and Holstein also became a Prussian province.</p>\n                        <p>On 18 August 1866, Prussia and a larger number of North and Central German states signed a Bündniß (alliance). The treaty created a military alliance for one year. It also affirmed that the states wanted to form a federal state based on the Prussian proposals of June 1866. They agreed to have a parliament elected to discuss a draft constitution. Later in 1866, other states joined the treaty. Saxony and Hesse-Darmstadt, former enemies in the war of 1866, had to agree their accession to the new federation in their respective peace treaties (Hesse-Darmstadt only joined with its northern province, Upper Hesse).</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Towards a federal constitution</h4>\n                        <p>Bismarck sought advice from conservative and democratic politicians and finally presented a draft constitution to the other state governments. A major factor in determining the form the new federal government would take was the aftermath of the recently concluded American Civil War, which had seen the southern states forcibly re-incorporated into the United States of America and slavery abolished. While few Germans were particularly sympathetic toward the precise institution (i.e. slavery) which had precipitated civil war in America, the prevailing viewpoint outside the U.S. at this time was that the slaves had only been emancipated as a reprisal for Southern secession from the American Union. With this in mind, many Catholics especially in Southern Germany feared that Prussia might one day might attempt to engineer a similar sort of secession crisis within a united Germany and use it as a pretext to launch a violent repression against Catholicism throughout Germany.</p>\n                        <p>Thus, it was Bismarck's intention to make the new federal state look like a confederation in the tradition of the German Confederation, and explains the name of the country and several provisions in the draft constitution - Bismarck needed to make the federal state more attractive (or at least less repulsive) to southern German states which might later join.</p>\n                        <p>At the same time, in late 1866, Prussia and the other states prepared the election of a North German parliament. This konstituierender Reichstag was elected in February 1867 based on state laws. The konstituierender Reichstag gathered from February to April. In close talks with Bismarck it altered the draft constitution in some significant points. The konstituierender Reichstag was not a parliament but only an organ to discuss and accept the draft constitution. After that, the state parliaments (June 1867) ratified it so that on 1 July the constitution was enabled. In August, the first Reichstag of the new federal state was elected.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Customs Union</h4>\n                        <p>In June 1867 a conference took place between Prussia and the south German states, who were not members of the North German Confederation. After pressure from Prussia, new Customs Union (Zollverein) treaties were signed the following month. Henceforth, the governing bodies of the Customs Union were the Bundesrat and Reichstag of the North German Confederation, augmented by representatives of the south German governments in the former and members from these states elected in the same way as the others in the latter. When augmented thus for customs matters, the institutions were known as the Federal Customs Council and the Customs Parliament (Zollparlament).[8] On 1 January 1868 the new institutions came into force. Bismarck hoped that the Zollverein might become the vehicle of German unification. But in the 1868 Zollparlament election the South Germans voted mainly for anti-Prussian parties.</p>\n                        <p>On the other hand, the two Mecklenburg duchies and three Hanseatic cities were initially not members of the Customs Union. The Mecklenburgs and Lubeck joined soon after the North German Confederation was formed. Eventually, after heavy Prussian pressure, Hamburg acceded to the Customs Union in 1888. Bremen joined at the same time. Despite this, all these states fully participated in the federal institutions, even while outside the Customs Union and not directly affected by their decisions in that regard.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Transition to the German Empire (1870–71)</h4>\n                        <p>In mid-1870, a diplomatic crisis concerning the Spanish throne led eventually to the Franco-Prussian War.[9] During the war, in November 1870, the North German Confederation and the south German states of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden (together with the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt which had not originally joined the confederation) united to form a new nation state. It was originally called Deutscher Bund (German Confederation), but on 10 December 1870 the Reichstag of the North German Confederation adopted the name Deutsches Reich (German Realm or German Empire) and granted the title of German Emperor to the King of Prussia as Bundespräsidium of the Confederation.[10] On 1 January 1871 the new constitution gave the country the name 'German Empire' and the title of Emperor to King William.

As these events occurred, the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War.</p>\n                   <p>The German Empire consisted of 26 states, most of them ruled by royal families. They included four kingdoms, six grand duchies, five duchies (six before 1876), seven principalities, three free Hanseatic cities, and one imperial territory. Although Prussia was one of four kingdoms in the realm, it contained about two-thirds of Germany's population and territory. Prussian dominance had also been constitutionally established, as the King of Prussia was also the German Emperor.</p>\n                   <p>After 1850, the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized, with particular strengths in coal, iron (and later steel), chemicals, and railways. In 1871, Germany had a population of 41 million people; by 1913, this had increased to 68 million. A heavily rural collection of states in 1815, the now united Germany became predominantly urban.[17] During its 47 years of existence, the German Empire was an industrial, technological, and scientific giant, gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country.[18] Between 1901 and 1918, the Germans won four Nobel Prizes in Medicine, six Prizes in Physics, seven Prizes in Chemistry, and three Prizes in Literature. By 1913, Germany was the largest economy in Continental Europe, surpassing the United Kingdom (excluding its Empire and Dominions), as well as the third-largest in the world, only behind the United States and the British Empire,[19] which were also its main economic rivals.</p>\n                   <p>From 1871 to 1890, Otto von Bismarck's tenure as the first and to this day longest-serving Chancellor was marked by relative liberalism, but it became more conservative afterward. Broad reforms and the Kulturkampf marked his period in the office. Late in Bismarck's chancellorship and in spite of his earlier personal opposition, Germany became involved in colonialism. Claiming much of the leftover territory that was yet unclaimed in the Scramble for Africa, it managed to build the third-largest colonial empire at the time, after the British and the French ones.[20] As a colonial state, it sometimes clashed with the interests of other European powers, especially the British Empire. During its colonial expansion, the German Empire committed the Herero and Namaqua genocide.</p>\n                   <p>Germany became a great power, boasting a rapidly developing rail network, the world's strongest army,[22] and a fast-growing industrial base.[23] Starting very small in 1871, in a decade, the navy became second only to Britain's Royal Navy. After the removal of Otto von Bismarck by Wilhelm II in 1890, the empire embarked on Weltpolitik – a bellicose new course that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of World War I. In addition, Bismarck's successors were incapable of maintaining their predecessor's complex, shifting, and overlapping alliances which had kept Germany from being diplomatically isolated. This period was marked by various factors influencing the Emperor's decisions, which were often perceived as contradictory or unpredictable by the public. In 1879, the German Empire consolidated the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary, followed by the Triple Alliance with Italy in 1882. It also retained strong diplomatic ties to the Ottoman Empire. When the great crisis of 1914 arrived, Italy left the alliance and the Ottoman Empire formally allied with Germany.</p>\n                   <p>In the First World War, German plans to capture Paris quickly in the autumn of 1914 failed. The war on the Western Front became a stalemate. The Allied naval blockade caused severe shortages of food. However, Imperial Germany had success on the Eastern Front; it occupied a large amount of territory to its east following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The German declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 contributed to bringing the United States into the war.</p>\n                   <p>The high command under Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff increasingly controlled the country, but in October 1918, after the failed Spring Offensive, the German armies were in retreat, allies Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire had collapsed, and Bulgaria had surrendered. The empire collapsed in the November 1918 Revolution with the abdications of its monarchs. This left a post-war federal republic and a devastated and unsatisfied populace, faced with post-war reparation costs of nearly 270 billion dollars,[24] all of which is considered a leading factor in the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>People</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Language</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Religion</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Language</h4>\n                        <p>About 92% of the population spoke German as their first language.

Low German was spoken throughout northern Germany and, though linguistically as distinct from High German (Hochdeutsch) as from Dutch and English, was considered \"German\", hence also its name. Danish and Frisian were spoken predominantly in the north of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein and Dutch in the western border areas of Prussia (Hanover, Westphalia, and the Rhine Province).</p>\n                        <p>Polish and other West Slavic languages (6.28%) were spoken chiefly in the east.</p>\n                        <p>A few (0.5%) spoke French, the vast majority of these in the Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen where francophones formed 11.6% of the total population.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Religion</h4>\n                        <p>Generally, religious demographics of the early modern period hardly changed. Still, there were almost entirely Catholic areas (Lower and Upper Bavaria, northern Westphalia, Upper Silesia, etc.) and almost entirely Protestant areas (Schleswig-Holstein, Pomerania, Saxony, etc.). Confessional prejudices, especially towards mixed marriages, were still common. Bit by bit, through internal migration, religious blending was more and more common. In eastern territories, confession was almost uniquely perceived to be connected to one's ethnicity and the equation \"Protestant = German, Catholic = Polish\" was held to be valid. In areas affected by immigration in the Ruhr area and Westphalia, as well as in some large cities, religious landscape changed substantially. This was especially true in largely Catholic areas of Westphalia, which changed through Protestant immigration from the eastern provinces.</p>\n                        <p>Politically, the confessional division of Germany had considerable consequences. In Catholic areas, the Centre Party had a big electorate. On the other hand, Social Democrats and Free Trade Unions usually received hardly any votes in the Catholic areas of the Ruhr. This began to change with the secularization arising in the last decades of the German Empire.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn03\" disabled=\"\">Background</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Bismarck era</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn05\">Wilhelmine era</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn06\">World War I</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn07\">Legacy</button>\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\">\n                        <h4>Background</h4>\n                        <p>The German Confederation had been created by an act of the Congress of Vienna on 8 June 1815 as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, after being alluded to in Article 6 of the 1814 Treaty of Paris.</p>\n                        <p>The liberal Revolutions of 1848 were crushed after the alliance between the educated, well-off bourgeois liberals and the urban artisans broke down; Otto von Bismarck's pragmatic Realpolitik, which appealed to peasants as well as the traditional aristocracy, took its place.[27] Bismarck sought to extend Hohenzollern hegemony throughout the German states; to do so meant unification of the German states and the exclusion of Prussia's main German rival, Austria, from the subsequent German Empire. He envisioned a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to persuade German people to do this: the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864, the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871.</p>\n                        <p>The German Confederation ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 between the constituent Confederation entities of the Austrian Empire and its allies on one side and Prussia and its allies on the other. The war resulted in the partial replacement of the Confederation in 1867 by a North German Confederation, comprising the 22 states north of the Main River. The patriotic fervor generated by the Franco-Prussian War overwhelmed the remaining opposition to a unified Germany (aside from Austria) in the four states south of the Main, and during November 1870, they joined the North German Confederation by treaty.</p>\n                        <h5>Foundation</h5>\n                        <p>On 10 December 1870, the North German Confederation Reichstag renamed the Confederation the \"German Empire\" and gave the title of German Emperor to William I, the King of Prussia, as Bundespräsidium of the Confederation.[29] The new constitution (Constitution of the German Confederation) and the title Emperor came into effect on 1 January 1871. During the Siege of Paris on 18 January 1871, William accepted to be proclaimed Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.</p>\n                        <p>The second German Constitution, adopted by the Reichstag on 14 April 1871 and proclaimed by the Emperor on 16 April,[30] was substantially based upon Bismarck's North German Constitution. The political system remained the same. The empire had a parliament called the Reichstag, which was elected by universal male suffrage. However, the original constituencies drawn in 1871 were never redrawn to reflect the growth of urban areas. As a result, by the time of the great expansion of German cities in the 1890s and 1900s, rural areas were grossly over-represented.</p>\n                        <p>The legislation also required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the 27 states. Executive power was vested in the emperor, or Kaiser, who was assisted by a Chancellor responsible only to him. The emperor was given extensive powers by the constitution. He alone appointed and dismissed the chancellor (so in practice, the emperor ruled the empire through the chancellor), was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and final arbiter of all foreign affairs, and could also disband the Reichstag to call for new elections. Officially, the chancellor was a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (top bureaucratic officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) functioned much like ministers in other monarchies. The Reichstag had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills and to initiate legislation. However, as mentioned above, in practice, the real power was vested in the emperor, who exercised it through his chancellor.</p>\n                        <p>Although nominally a federal empire and league of equals, in practice, the empire was dominated by the largest and most powerful state, Prussia. Prussia stretched across the northern two-thirds of the new Reich and contained three-fifths of its population. The imperial crown was hereditary in the ruling house of Prussia, the House of Hohenzollern. With the exception of 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of Prussia. With 17 out of 58 votes in the Bundesrat, Berlin needed only a few votes from the smaller states to exercise effective control.</p>\n                        <p>The other states retained their own governments but had only limited aspects of sovereignty. For example, both postage stamps and currency were issued for the empire as a whole. Coins through one mark were also minted in the name of the empire, while higher-valued pieces were issued by the states. However, these larger gold and silver issues were virtually commemorative coins and had limited circulation.</p>\n                        <p>While the states issued their own decorations and some had their own armies, the military forces of the smaller ones were put under Prussian control. Those of the larger states, such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony, were coordinated along Prussian principles and would, in wartime, be controlled by the federal government.</p>\n                        <p>The evolution of the German Empire is somewhat in line with parallel developments in Italy, which became a united nation-state a decade earlier. Some key elements of the German Empire's authoritarian political structure were also the basis for conservative modernization in Imperial Japan under Meiji and the preservation of an authoritarian political structure under the tsars in the Russian Empire.</p>\n                        <p>One factor in the social anatomy of these governments was the retention of a very substantial share in political power by the landed elite, the Junkers, resulting from the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the peasants in combination with urban areas.</p>\n                        <p>Although authoritarian in many respects, the empire had some democratic features. Besides universal suffrage, it permitted the development of political parties. Bismarck intended to create a constitutional façade that would mask the continuation of authoritarian policies. In the process, he created a system with a serious flaw. There was a significant disparity between the Prussian and German electoral systems. Prussia used a highly restrictive three-class voting system in which the richest third of the population could choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring a conservative majority. As mentioned above, the king and (with two exceptions) the prime minister of Prussia was also the emperor and chancellor of the empire – meaning that the same rulers had to seek majorities from legislatures elected from completely different franchises. Universal suffrage was significantly diluted by gross over-representation of rural areas from the 1890s onward. By the turn of the century, the urban-rural population balance was completely reversed from 1871; more than two-thirds of the empire's people lived in cities and towns.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Bismarck era</h4>\n                        <p>Bismarck's domestic policies played an important role in forging the authoritarian political culture of the Kaiserreich. Less preoccupied with continental power politics following unification in 1871, Germany's semi-parliamentary government carried out a relatively smooth economic and political revolution from above that pushed them along the way towards becoming the world's leading industrial power of the time.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck's \"revolutionary conservatism\" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just the Junker elite—more loyal to the throne and empire. According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was:</p>\n                        <p style=\"font-style: italic;\">granting social rights to enhance the integration of a hierarchical society, to forge a bond between workers and the state so as to strengthen the latter, to maintain traditional relations of authority between social and status groups, and to provide a countervailing power against the modernist forces of liberalism and socialism.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s and enacted universal male suffrage in 1871.[32] He became a great hero to German conservatives, who erected many monuments to his memory and tried to emulate his policies.</p>\n                        <h5>Foreign policy</h5>\n                        <p>Bismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was conservative and sought to preserve the balance of power in Europe. British historian Eric Hobsbawm concludes that he \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [devoting] himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".[34] This was a departure from his adventurous foreign policy for Prussia, where he favored strength and expansion, punctuating this by saying, \"The great question of the age are not settled by speeches and majority votes – this was the error of 1848–49 – but by iron and blood.\"</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck's chief concern was that France would plot revenge after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. As the French lacked the strength to defeat Germany by themselves, they sought an alliance with Russia, which would trap Germany between the two in a war (as would ultimately happen in 1914). Bismarck wanted to prevent this at all costs and maintain friendly relations with the Russians and thereby formed an alliance with them and Austria-Hungary, the Dreikaiserbund (League of Three Emperors), in 1881. The alliance was further cemented by a separate non-aggression pact with Russia called Reinsurance Treaty, which was signed in 1887.[36] During this period, individuals within the German military were advocating a preemptive strike against Russia, but Bismarck knew that such ideas were foolhardy. He once wrote that \"the most brilliant victories would not avail against the Russian nation, because of its climate, its desert, and its frugality, and having but one frontier to defend\", and because it would leave Germany with another bitter, resentful neighbor.</p>\n                        <p>Meanwhile, the chancellor remained wary of any foreign policy developments that looked even remotely warlike. In 1886, he moved to stop an attempted sale of horses to France because they might be used for cavalry and also ordered an investigation into large Russian purchases of medicine from a German chemical works. Bismarck stubbornly refused to listen to Georg Herbert zu Munster (ambassador to France), who reported back that the French were not seeking a revanchist war and were desperate for peace at all costs.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck and most of his contemporaries were conservative-minded and focused their foreign policy attention on Germany's neighboring states. In 1914, 60% of German foreign investment was in Europe, as opposed to just 5% of British investment. Most of the money went to developing nations such as Russia that lacked the capital or technical knowledge to industrialize on their own. The construction of the Baghdad Railway, financed by German banks, was designed to eventually connect Germany with the Ottoman Empire and the Persian Gulf, but it also collided with British and Russian geopolitical interests. Conflict over the Baghdad Railway was resolved in June 1914.</p>\n                        <p>Many consider Bismarck's foreign policy as a coherent system and partly responsible for the preservation of Europe's stability.[37] It was also marked by the need to balance circumspect defensiveness and the desire to be free from the constraints of its position as a major European power.[37] Bismarck's successors did not pursue his foreign policy legacy. For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who dismissed the chancellor in 1890, let the treaty with Russia lapse in favor of Germany's alliance with Austria, which finally led to a stronger coalition-building between Russia and France.</p>\n                        <h5>Colonies</h5>\n                        <p>Bismarck secured a number of German colonial possessions during the 1880s in Africa and the Pacific, but he never considered an overseas colonial empire valuable due to fierce resistance to German colonial rule from the natives. Thus, Germany's colonies remained badly undeveloped.[38] However, they excited the interest of the religious-minded, who supported an extensive network of missionaries.</p>\n                        <p>Germans had dreamed of colonial imperialism since 1848.[39] Bismarck began the process, and by 1884 had acquired German New Guinea.[40] By the 1890s, German colonial expansion in Asia and the Pacific (Kiauchau in China, Tientsin in China, the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, Samoa) led to frictions with the UK, Russia, Japan, and the US. The largest colonial enterprises were in Africa,[41] where the Herero Wars in what is now Namibia in 1906–1907 resulted in the Herero and Namaqua genocide.</p>\n                        <h5>Economy</h5>\n                        <p>By 1900, Germany became the largest economy in continental Europe and the third-largest in the world behind the United States and the British Empire, which were also its main economic rivals. Throughout its existence, it experienced economic growth and modernization led by heavy industry. In 1871, it had a largely rural population of 41 million, while by 1913, this had increased to a predominantly urban population of 68 million.</p>\n                        <h5>Industrial power</h5>\n                        <p>For 30 years, Germany struggled against Britain to be Europe's leading industrial power. Representative of Germany's industry was the steel giant Krupp, whose first factory was built in Essen. By 1902, the factory alone became \"A great city with its own streets, its own police force, fire department and traffic laws. There are 150 kilometers of rail, 60 different factory buildings, 8,500 machine tools, seven electrical stations, 140 kilometers of underground cable, and 46 overhead.\"</p>\n                        <p>Under Bismarck, Germany was a world innovator in building the welfare state. German workers enjoyed health, accident and maternity benefits, canteens, changing rooms, and a national pension scheme.</p>\n                        <h5>Railways</h5>\n                        <p>Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centers of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and forged ahead of France.[45] The total length of German railroad tracks expanded from 21,000 kilometers in 1871 to 63,000 kilometers by 1913, establishing the largest rail network in the world after the United States, and effectively surpassing the 32,000 kilometers of rail that connected Britain in the same year.</p>\n                        <h5>Industry</h5>\n                        <p>Industrialisation progressed dynamically in Germany, and German manufacturers began to capture domestic markets from British imports, and also to compete with British industry abroad, particularly in the U.S. The German textile and metal industries had by 1870 surpassed those of Britain in organisation and technical efficiency and superseded British manufacturers in the domestic market. Germany became the dominant economic power on the continent and was the second-largest exporting nation after Britain.</p>\n                        <p>Technological progress during German industrialisation occurred in four waves: the railway wave (1877–1886), the dye wave (1887–1896), the chemical wave (1897–1902), and the wave of electrical engineering (1903–1918).[47] Since Germany industrialised later than Britain, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. Germany's dominance in physics and chemistry was such that one-third of all Nobel Prizes went to German inventors and researchers. The German cartel system (known as Konzerne), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital. Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany's annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.</p>\n                        <p>By 1900, the German chemical industry dominated the world market for synthetic dyes.[49] The three major firms BASF,[50] Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms. In 1913, these eight firms produced almost 90% of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80% of their production abroad. The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers; leading Chandler to call the German dye companies \"the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises\".[51] There were many spinoffs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.</p>\n                        <p>By the start of World War I (1914–1918), German industry switched to war production. The heaviest demands were on coal and steel for artillery and shell production, and on chemicals for the synthesis of materials that were subject to import restrictions and for chemical weapons and war supplies.</p>\n                        <h5>Consolidation</h5>\n                        <p>The creation of the Empire under Prussian leadership was a victory for the concept of Kleindeutschland (Smaller Germany) over the Großdeutschland concept. This meant that Austria-Hungary, a multi-ethnic Empire with a considerable German-speaking population, would remain outside of the German nation state. Bismarck's policy was to pursue a solution diplomatically. The effective alliance between Germany and Austria played a major role in Germany's decision to enter World War I in 1914.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck announced there would be no more territorial additions to Germany in Europe, and his diplomacy after 1871 was focused on stabilizing the European system and preventing any wars. He succeeded, and only after his departure from office in 1890 did the diplomatic tensions start rising again.</p>\n                        <h5>Social issues</h5>\n                        <p>After achieving formal unification in 1871, Bismarck devoted much of his attention to the cause of national unity. He opposed Catholic civil rights and emancipation, especially the influence of the Vatican under Pope Pius IX, and working-class radicalism, represented by the emerging Social Democratic Party.</p>\n                        <h5>Kulturkampf</h5>\n                        <p>Prussia in 1871 included 16,000,000 Protestants, both Reformed and Lutheran, and 8,000,000 Catholics. Most people were generally segregated into their own religious worlds, living in rural districts or city neighbourhoods that were overwhelmingly of the same religion, and sending their children to separate public schools where their religion was taught. There was little interaction or intermarriage. On the whole, the Protestants had a higher social status, and the Catholics were more likely to be peasant farmers or unskilled or semiskilled industrial workers. In 1870, the Catholics formed their own political party, the Centre Party, which generally supported unification and most of Bismarck's policies. However, Bismarck distrusted parliamentary democracy in general and opposition parties in particular, especially when the Centre Party showed signs of gaining support among dissident elements such as the Polish Catholics in Silesia. A powerful intellectual force of the time was anti-Catholicism, led by the liberal intellectuals who formed a vital part of Bismarck's coalition. They saw the Catholic Church as a powerful force of reaction and anti-modernity, especially after the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870, and the tightening control of the Vatican over the local bishops.</p>\n                        <p>The Kulturkampf launched by Bismarck 1871–1880 affected Prussia; although there were similar movements in Baden and Hesse, the rest of Germany was not affected. According to the new imperial constitution, the states were in charge of religious and educational affairs; they funded the Protestant and Catholic schools. In July 1871 Bismarck abolished the Catholic section of the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs, depriving Catholics of their voice at the highest level. The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone.</p>\n                        <p>Much more serious were the May laws of 1873. One made the appointment of any priest dependent on his attendance at a German university, as opposed to the seminaries that the Catholics typically used. Furthermore, all candidates for the ministry had to pass an examination in German culture before a state board which weeded out intransigent Catholics. Another provision gave the government a veto power over most church activities. A second law abolished the jurisdiction of the Vatican over the Catholic Church in Prussia; its authority was transferred to a government body controlled by Protestants.</p>\n                        <p>Nearly all German bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant in the face of heavier and heavier penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government. By 1876, all the Prussian bishops were imprisoned or in exile, and a third of the Catholic parishes were without a priest. In the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared the whole ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed. There was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines, and rallied behind their church and the Centre Party. The \"Old Catholic Church\", which rejected the First Vatican Council, attracted only a few thousand members. Bismarck, a devout pietistic Protestant, realized his Kulturkampf was backfiring when secular and socialist elements used the opportunity to attack all religion. In the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters, and their insistence on protecting their religious identity. In the elections of 1874, the Centre party doubled its popular vote, and became the second-largest party in the national parliament—and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years, so that after Bismarck it became difficult to form a government without their support.</p>\n                        <h5>Social reform</h5>\n                        <p>Bismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old-age pensions, accident insurance, medical care and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European welfare state. He came to realize that this sort of policy was very appealing, since it bound workers to the state, and also fit in very well with his authoritarian nature. The social security systems installed by Bismarck (health care in 1883, accident insurance in 1884, invalidity and old-age insurance in 1889) at the time were the largest in the world and, to a degree, still exist in Germany today.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck's paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.[44][59] Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.</p>\n                        <h5>Germanisation</h5>\n                        <p>One of the effects of the unification policies was the gradually increasing tendency to eliminate the use of non-German languages in public life, schools and academic settings with the intent of pressuring the non-German population to abandon their national identity in what was called \"Germanisation\". These policies often had the reverse effect of stimulating resistance, usually in the form of homeschooling and tighter unity in the minority groups, especially the Poles.</p>\n                        <p>The Germanisation policies were targeted particularly against the significant Polish minority of the empire, gained by Prussia in the partitions of Poland. Poles were treated as an ethnic minority even where they made up the majority, as in the Province of Posen, where a series of anti-Polish measures was enforced.[62] Numerous anti-Polish laws had no great effect especially in the province of Posen where the German-speaking population dropped from 42.8% in 1871 to 38.1% in 1905, despite all efforts.</p>\n                        <h5>Antisemitism</h5>\n                        <p>Antisemitism was endemic in Germany during the period. Before Napoleon's decrees ended the ghettos in Germany, it had been religiously motivated, but by the 19th century, it was a factor in German nationalism. In the popular mind Jews became a symbol of capitalism and wealth. On the other hand, the constitution and legal system protected the rights of Jews as German citizens. Antisemitic parties were formed but soon collapsed.</p>\n                        <h5>Law</h5>\n                        <p>Bismarck's efforts also initiated the levelling of the enormous differences between the German states, which had been independent in their evolution for centuries, especially with legislation. The completely different legal histories and judicial systems posed enormous complications, especially for national trade. While a common trade code had already been introduced by the Confederation in 1861 (which was adapted for the Empire and, with great modifications, is still in effect today), there was little similarity in laws otherwise.</p>\n                        <p>In 1871, a common Criminal Code (Reichsstrafgesetzbuch [de]) was introduced; in 1877, common court procedures were established in the court system (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz [de]), code of civil procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) and code of criminal procedure (Strafprozessordnung [de]). In 1873 the constitution was amended to allow the Empire to replace the various and greatly differing Civil Codes of the states (If they existed at all; for example, parts of Germany formerly occupied by Napoleon's France had adopted the French Civil Code, while in Prussia the Allgemeines Preußisches Landrecht of 1794 was still in effect). In 1881, a first commission was established to produce a common Civil Code for all of the Empire, an enormous effort that would produce the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), possibly one of the most impressive legal works in the world; it was eventually put into effect on 1 January 1900. All of these codifications are, albeit with many amendments, still in effect today.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Wilhelmine era</h4>\n                        <h5>Bismarck's resignation</h5>\n                        <p>Wilhelm II wanted to reassert his ruling prerogatives at a time when other monarchs in Europe were being transformed into constitutional figureheads. This decision led the ambitious Kaiser into conflict with Bismarck. The old chancellor had hoped to guide Wilhelm as he had guided his grandfather, but the emperor wanted to be the master in his own house and had many sycophants telling him that Frederick the Great would not have been great with a Bismarck at his side.[66] A key difference between Wilhelm II and Bismarck was their approaches to handling political crises, especially in 1889, when German coal miners went on strike in Upper Silesia. Bismarck demanded that the German Army be sent in to crush the strike, but Wilhelm II rejected this authoritarian measure, responding \"I do not wish to stain my reign with the blood of my subjects.\"[67] Instead of condoning repression, Wilhelm had the government negotiate with a delegation from the coal miners, which brought the strike to an end without violence.[66] The fractious relationship ended in March 1890, after Wilhelm II and Bismarck quarrelled, and the chancellor resigned days later.[66] Bismarck's last few years had seen power slip from his hands as he grew older, more irritable, more authoritarian, and less focused.</p>\n                        <p>With Bismarck's departure, Wilhelm II became the dominant ruler of Germany. Unlike his grandfather, Wilhelm I, who had been largely content to leave government affairs to the chancellor, Wilhelm II wanted to be fully informed and actively involved in running Germany, not an ornamental figurehead, although most Germans found his claims of divine right to rule amusing.[68] Wilhelm allowed politician Walther Rathenau to tutor him in European economics and industrial and financial realities in Europe.</p>\n                        <p>As Hull (2004) notes, Bismarckian foreign policy \"was too sedate for the reckless Kaiser\".[69] Wilhelm became internationally notorious for his aggressive stance on foreign policy and his strategic blunders (such as the Tangier Crisis), which pushed the German Empire into growing political isolation and eventually helped to cause World War I.</p>\n                        <h5>Domestic affairs</h5>\n                        <p>Under Wilhelm II, Germany no longer had long-ruling strong chancellors like Bismarck. The new chancellors had difficulty in performing their roles, especially the additional role as Prime Minister of Prussia assigned to them in the German Constitution. The reforms of Chancellor Leo von Caprivi, which liberalized trade and so reduced unemployment, were supported by the Kaiser and most Germans except for Prussian landowners, who feared loss of land and power and launched several campaigns against the reforms</p>\n                        <p>While Prussian aristocrats challenged the demands of a united German state, in the 1890s several organizations were set up to challenge the authoritarian conservative Prussian militarism which was being imposed on the country. Educators opposed to the German state-run schools, which emphasized military education, set up their own independent liberal schools, which encouraged individuality and freedom.[71] However nearly all the schools in Imperial Germany had a very high standard and kept abreast with modern developments in knowledge.</p>\n                        <p>Artists began experimental art in opposition to Kaiser Wilhelm's support for traditional art, to which Wilhelm responded \"art which transgresses the laws and limits laid down by me can no longer be called art\".[73] It was largely thanks to Wilhelm's influence that most printed material in Germany used blackletter instead of the Roman type used in the rest of Western Europe. At the same time, a new generation of cultural creators emerged.</p>\n                        <p>From the 1890s onwards, the most effective opposition to the monarchy came from the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), whose radicals advocated Marxism. The threat of the SPD to the German monarchy and industrialists caused the state both to crack down on the party's supporters and to implement its own programme of social reform to soothe discontent. Germany's large industries provided significant social welfare programmes and good care to their employees, as long as they were not identified as socialists or trade-union members. The larger industrial firms provided pensions, sickness benefits and even housing to their employees.</p>\n                        <p>Having learned from the failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf, Wilhelm II maintained good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and concentrated on opposing socialism.[75] This policy failed when the Social Democrats won a third of the votes in the 1912 elections to the Reichstag, and became the largest political party in Germany. The government remained in the hands of a succession of conservative coalitions supported by right-wing liberals or Catholic clerics and heavily dependent on the Kaiser's favour. The rising militarism under Wilhelm II caused many Germans to emigrate to the U.S. and the British colonies to escape mandatory military service.</p>\n                        <p>During World War I, the Kaiser increasingly devolved his powers to the leaders of the German High Command, particularly future President of Germany, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff. Hindenburg took over the role of commander–in–chief from the Kaiser, while Ludendorff became de facto general chief of staff. By 1916, Germany was effectively a military dictatorship run by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, with the Kaiser reduced to a mere figurehead.</p>\n                        <h5>Colonialism</h5>\n                        <p>Wilhelm II wanted Germany to have her \"place in the sun\", like Britain, which he constantly wished to emulate or rival.[77] With German traders and merchants already active worldwide, he encouraged colonial efforts in Africa and the Pacific (\"new imperialism\"), causing the German Empire to vie with other European powers for remaining \"unclaimed\" territories. With the encouragement or at least the acquiescence of Britain, which at this stage saw Germany as a counterweight to her old rival France, Germany acquired German Southwest Africa (modern Namibia), German Kamerun (modern Cameroon), Togoland (modern Togo) and German East Africa (modern Rwanda, Burundi, and the mainland part of current Tanzania). Islands were gained in the Pacific through purchase and treaties and also a 99-year lease for the territory of Kiautschou in northeast China. But of these German colonies only Togoland and German Samoa (after 1908) became self-sufficient and profitable; all the others required subsidies from the Berlin treasury for building infrastructure, school systems, hospitals and other institutions.</p>\n                        <p>Bismarck had originally dismissed the agitation for colonies with contempt; he favoured a Eurocentric foreign policy, as the treaty arrangements made during his tenure in office show. As a latecomer to colonization, Germany repeatedly came into conflict with the established colonial powers and also with the United States, which opposed German attempts at colonial expansion in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. Native insurrections in German territories received prominent coverage in other countries, especially in Britain; the established powers had dealt with such uprisings decades earlier, often brutally, and had secured firm control of their colonies by then. The Boxer Rising in China, which the Chinese government eventually sponsored, began in the Shandong province, in part because Germany, as colonizer at Kiautschou, was an untested power and had only been active there for two years. Eight western nations, including the United States, mounted a joint relief force to rescue westerners caught up in the rebellion. During the departure ceremonies for the German contingent, Wilhelm II urged them to behave like the Hun invaders of continental Europe – an unfortunate remark that would later be resurrected by British propagandists to paint Germans as barbarians during World War I and World War II. On two occasions, a French-German conflict over the fate of Morocco seemed inevitable.</p>\n                        <p>Upon acquiring Southwest Africa, German settlers were encouraged to cultivate land held by the Herero and Nama. Herero and Nama tribal lands were used for a variety of exploitative goals (much as the British did before in Rhodesia), including farming, ranching, and mining for minerals and diamonds. In 1904, the Herero and the Nama revolted against the colonists in Southwest Africa, killing farm families, their laborers and servants. In response to the attacks, troops were dispatched to quell the uprising which then resulted in the Herero and Namaqua Genocide. In total, some 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population) perished. The commander of the punitive expedition, General Lothar von Trotha, was eventually relieved and reprimanded for his usurpation of orders and the cruelties he inflicted. These occurrences were sometimes referred to as \"the first genocide of the 20th century\" and officially condemned by the United Nations in 1985. In 2004 a formal apology by a government minister of the Federal Republic of Germany followed.</p>\n                        <h5>Middle East</h5>\n                        <p>Bismarck and Wilhelm II after him sought closer economic ties with the Ottoman Empire. Under Wilhelm II, with the financial backing of the Deutsche Bank, the Baghdad Railway was begun in 1900, although by 1914 it was still 500 km (310 mi) short of its destination in Baghdad.[78] In an interview with Wilhelm in 1899, Cecil Rhodes had tried \"to convince the Kaiser that the future of the German empire abroad lay in the Middle East\" and not in Africa; with a grand Middle-Eastern empire, Germany could afford to allow Britain the unhindered completion of the Cape-to-Cairo railway that Rhodes favoured.[79] Britain initially supported the Baghdad Railway; but by 1911 British statesmen came to fear it might be extended to Basra on the Persian Gulf, threatening Britain's naval supremacy in the Indian Ocean. Accordingly, they asked to have construction halted, to which Germany and the Ottoman Empire acquiesced.</p>\n                        <h5>South America</h5>\n                        <p>In South America, Germany's primary interest was in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay and viewed the countries of northern South America – Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela – as a buffer to protect its interest from the growing influence of the United States.[80] Policymakers in Germany analysed the possibility of establishing bases in Margarita Island and showed interest in the Galápagos Islands but soon abandoned any such designs given that far-flung bases in northern South America would be very vulnerable.[81][80] Germany attempted to promote Chile, a country that was heavily influenced by Germany,[82] into a regional counterweight to the United States.[80] Germany and Britain managed through Chile to have Ecuador deny the United States a naval base in the Galápagos Islands.</p>\n                        <p>Claims that German communties in South America acted as extensions of the German Empire were ubiquituous by 1900 but it has never been proved that these communities acted in such way to any significant degree.[83] German political, cultural and scientific influence was particularly intense in Chile in the decades before World War I, and the prestige of Germany and German things in Chile remained high after the war but did not recover to its pre-war levels.</p>\n                        <h5>Pre-war Europe</h5>\n                        <p>Wilhelm II and his advisers committed a fatal diplomatic error when they allowed the \"Reinsurance Treaty\" that Bismarck had negotiated with Tsarist Russia to lapse. Germany was left with no firm ally but Austria-Hungary, and her support for action in annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 further soured relations with Russia.[84] Wilhelm missed the opportunity to secure an alliance with Britain in the 1890s when it was involved in colonial rivalries with France, and he alienated British statesmen further by openly supporting the Boers in the South African War and building a navy to rival Britain's. By 1911 Wilhelm had completely picked apart the careful power balance established by Bismarck and Britain turned to France in the Entente Cordiale. Germany's only other ally besides Austria was the Kingdom of Italy, but it remained an ally only pro forma. When war came, Italy saw more benefit in an alliance with Britain, France, and Russia, which, in the secret Treaty of London in 1915 promised it the frontier districts of Austria where Italians formed the majority of the population and also colonial concessions. Germany did acquire a second ally that same year when the Ottoman Empire entered the war on its side, but in the long run, supporting the Ottoman war effort only drained away German resources from the main fronts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>World War I</h4>\n                        <h5>Origins</h5>\n                        <p>Following the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian Archduke of Franz Ferdinand by a Bosnian Serb, the Kaiser offered Emperor Franz Joseph full support for Austro-Hungarian plans to invade the Kingdom of Serbia, which Austria-Hungary blamed for the assassination. This unconditional support for Austria-Hungary was called a \"blank cheque\" by historians, including German Fritz Fischer. Subsequent interpretation – for example at the Versailles Peace Conference – was that this \"blank cheque\" licensed Austro-Hungarian aggression regardless of the diplomatic consequences, and thus Germany bore responsibility for starting the war, or at least provoking a wider conflict.</p>\n                        <p>Germany began the war by targeting its chief rival, France. Germany saw France as its principal danger on the European continent as it could mobilize much faster than Russia and bordered Germany's industrial core in the Rhineland. Unlike Britain and Russia, the French entered the war mainly for revenge against Germany, in particular for France's loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany in 1871. The German high command knew that France would muster its forces to go into Alsace-Lorraine. Aside from the very unofficial Septemberprogramm, the Germans never stated a clear list of goals that they wanted out of the war.</p>\n                        <h5>Western Front</h5>\n                        <p>Germany did not want to risk lengthy battles along the Franco-German border and instead adopted the Schlieffen Plan, a military strategy designed to cripple France by invading Belgium and Luxembourg, sweeping down to encircle and crush both Paris and the French forces along the Franco-German border in a quick victory. After defeating France, Germany would turn to attack Russia. The plan required violating the official neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg, which Britain had guaranteed by treaty. However, the Germans had calculated that Britain would enter the war regardless of whether they had formal justification to do so.[citation needed] At first the attack was successful: the German Army swept down from Belgium and Luxembourg and advanced on Paris, at the nearby River Marne. However, the evolution of weapons over the last century heavily favored defense over offense, especially thanks to the machine gun, so that it took proportionally more offensive force to overcome a defensive position. This resulted in the German lines on the offense contracting to keep up the offensive timetable while correspondingly the French lines were extending. In addition, some German units that were originally slotted for the German far-right were transferred to the Eastern Front in reaction to Russia mobilizing far faster than anticipated. The combined effect had the German right flank sweeping down in front of Paris instead of behind it exposing the German Right flank to the extending French lines and attack from strategic French reserves stationed in Paris. Attacking the exposed German right flank, the French Army and the British Army put up a strong resistance to the defense of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne, resulting in the German Army retreating to defensive positions along the river Aisne. A subsequent Race to the Sea resulted in a long-held stalemate between the German Army and the Allies in dug-in trench warfare positions from Alsace to Flanders.</p>\n                        <p>German attempts to break through failed at the two battles of Ypres (1st/2nd) with huge casualties. A series of allied offensives in 1915 against German positions in Artois and Champagne resulted in huge allied casualties and little territorial change. German Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn decided to exploit the defensive advantages that had shown themselves in the 1915 Allied offensives by attempting to goad France into attacking strong defensive positions near the ancient city of Verdun. Verdun had been one of the last cities to hold out against the German Army in 1870, and Falkenhayn predicted that as a matter of national pride the French would do anything to ensure that it was not taken. He expected that he could take strong defensive positions in the hills overlooking Verdun on the east bank of the River Meuse to threaten the city and the French would launch desperate attacks against these positions. He predicted that French losses would be greater than those of the Germans and that continued French commitment of troops to Verdun would \"bleed the French Army white.\" In 1916, the Battle of Verdun began, with the French positions under constant shelling and poison gas attack and taking large casualties under the assault of overwhelmingly large German forces. However, Falkenhayn's prediction of a greater ratio of French killed proved to be wrong as both sides took heavy casualties. Falkenhayn was replaced by Erich Ludendorff, and with no success in sight, the German Army pulled out of Verdun in December 1916 and the battle ended.</p>\n                        <h5>Eastern Front</h5>\n                        <p>While the Western Front was a stalemate for the German Army, the Eastern Front eventually proved to be a great success. Despite initial setbacks due to the unexpectedly rapid mobilisation of the Russian army, which resulted in a Russian invasion of East Prussia and Austrian Galicia, the badly organised and supplied Russian Army faltered and the German and Austro-Hungarian armies thereafter steadily advanced eastward. The Germans benefited from political instability in Russia and its population's desire to end the war. In 1917 the German government allowed Russia's communist Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin to travel through Germany from Switzerland into Russia. Germany believed that if Lenin could create further political unrest, Russia would no longer be able to continue its war with Germany, allowing the German Army to focus on the Western Front.</p>\n                        <p>In March 1917, the Tsar was ousted from the Russian throne, and in November a Bolshevik government came to power under the leadership of Lenin. Facing political opposition from the Bolsheviks, he decided to end Russia's campaign against Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria to redirect Bolshevik energy to eliminating internal dissent. In March 1918, by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bolshevik government gave Germany and the Ottoman Empire enormous territorial and economic concessions in exchange for an end to war on the Eastern Front. All of the modern-day Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) were given over to the German occupation authority Ober Ost, along with Belarus and Ukraine. Thus Germany had at last achieved its long-wanted dominance of \"Mitteleuropa\" (Central Europe) and could now focus fully on defeating the Allies on the Western Front. In practice, however, the forces that were needed to garrison and secure the new territories were a drain on the German war effort.</p>\n                        <h5>Colonies</h5>\n                        <p>Germany quickly lost almost all its colonies. However, in German East Africa, an impressive guerrilla campaign was waged by the colonial army leader there, General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck. Using Germans and native Askaris, Lettow-Vorbeck launched multiple guerrilla raids against British forces in Kenya and Rhodesia. He also invaded Portuguese Mozambique to gain his forces supplies and to pick up more Askari recruits. His force was still active at war's end.</p>\n                        <h5>1918</h5>\n                        <p>The defeat of Russia in 1917 enabled Germany to transfer hundreds of thousands of troops from the Eastern to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies. By retraining the soldiers in new infiltration tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the battlefield and win a decisive victory before the army of the United States, which had now entered the war on the side of the Allies, arrived in strength.[87] In what was known as the \"kaiserschlacht\", Germany converged their troops and delivered multiple blows that pushed back the allies. However, the repeated German offensives in the spring of 1918 all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped and the Germans lacked the reserves needed to consolidate their gains. Meanwhile, soldiers had become radicalised by the Russian Revolution and were less willing to continue fighting. The war effort sparked civil unrest in Germany, while the troops, who had been constantly in the field without relief, grew exhausted and lost all hope of victory. In the summer of 1918, the British Army was at its peak strength with as many as 4.5 million men on the western front and 4,000 tanks for the Hundred Days Offensive, the Americans arriving at the rate of 10,000 a day, Germany's allies facing collapse and the German Empire's manpower exhausted, it was only a matter of time before multiple Allied offensives destroyed the German army.</p>\n                        <h5>Home front</h5>\n                        <p>The concept of \"total war\" meant that supplies had to be redirected towards the armed forces and, with German commerce being stopped by the Allied naval blockade, German civilians were forced to live in increasingly meagre conditions. First food prices were controlled, then rationing was introduced. During the war about 750,000 German civilians died from malnutrition.</p>\n                        <p>Towards the end of the war, conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. The causes included the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railway system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade. The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the \"turnip winter\", because the people had to survive on a vegetable more commonly reserved for livestock, as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the soldiers' rations.[90] The morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.</p>\n                        <h5>Spanish Flu Pandemic</h5>\n                        <p>The population of Germany was already suffering from outbreaks of disease due to malnutrition due to Allied blockade preventing food imports. Spanish flu arrived in Germany with returning troops. Around 287,000 people died of Spanish flu in Germany between 1918 and 1920.</p>\n                        <h5>Revolt and demise</h5>\n                        <p>Many Germans wanted an end to the war and increasing numbers began to associate with the political left, such as the Social Democratic Party and the more radical Independent Social Democratic Party, which demanded an end to the war. The entry of the U.S. into the war in April 1917 tipped the long-run balance of power even more in favour of the Allies.</p>\n                        <p>The end of October 1918, in Kiel, in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the German Revolution of 1918–1919. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior generals lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government.</p>\n                        <p>Bulgaria signed the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September 1918. The Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918. Between 24 October and 3 November 1918, Italy defeated Austria-Hungary in the battle of Vittorio Veneto, which forced Austria-Hungary to sign the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November 1918. So, in November 1918, with internal revolution, the Allies advancing toward Germany on the Western Front, Austria-Hungary falling apart from multiple ethnic tensions, its other allies out of the war and pressure from the German high command, the Kaiser and all German ruling kings, dukes, and princes abdicated, and German nobility was abolished. On 9 November, the Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed a republic. The new government led by the German Social Democrats called for and received an armistice on 11 November. It was succeeded by the Weimar Republic.[91] Those opposed, including disaffected veterans, joined a diverse set of paramilitary and underground political groups such as the Freikorps, the Organisation Consul, and the Communists.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art07\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Legacy</h4>\n                        <p>The defeat and aftermath of the First World War and the penalties imposed by the Treaty of Versailles shaped the positive memory of the Empire, especially among Germans who distrusted and despised the Weimar Republic. Conservatives, liberals, socialists, nationalists, Catholics and Protestants all had their own interpretations, which led to a fractious political and social climate in Germany in the aftermath of the empire's collapse.</p>\n                        <p>Under Bismarck, a united German state had finally been achieved, but it remained a Prussian-dominated state and did not include German Austria as Pan-German nationalists had desired. The influence of Prussian militarism, the Empire's colonial efforts and its vigorous, competitive industrial prowess all gained it the dislike and envy of other nations. The German Empire enacted a number of progressive reforms, such as Europe's first social welfare system and freedom of press. There was also a modern system for electing the federal parliament, the Reichstag, in which every adult man had one vote. This enabled the Socialists and the Catholic Centre Party to play considerable roles in the empire's political life despite the continued hostility of Prussian aristocrats.</p>\n                        <p>The era of the German Empire is well remembered in Germany as one of great cultural and intellectual vigour. Thomas Mann published his novel Buddenbrooks in 1901. Theodor Mommsen received the Nobel prize for literature a year later for his Roman history. Painters like the groups Der Blaue Reiter and Die Brücke made a significant contribution to modern art. The AEG turbine factory in Berlin by Peter Behrens from 1909 was a milestone in classic modern architecture and an outstanding example of emerging functionalism. The social, economic, and scientific successes of this Gründerzeit, or founding epoch, have sometimes led the Wilhelmine era to be regarded as a golden age.</p>\n                        <p>In the field of economics, the \"Kaiserzeit\" laid the foundation of Germany's status as one of the world's leading economic powers. The iron and coal industries of the Ruhr, the Saar and Upper Silesia especially contributed to that process. The first motorcar was built by Karl Benz in 1886. The enormous growth of industrial production and industrial potential also led to a rapid urbanisation of Germany, which turned the Germans into a nation of city dwellers. More than 5 million people left Germany for the United States during the 19th century.</p>\n                        <h5>Sonderweg</h5>\n                        <p>Many historians have emphasized the central importance of a German Sonderweg or \"special path\" (or \"exceptionalism\") as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the 20th century. According to the historiography by Kocka (1988), the process of nation-building from above had very grievous long-term implications. In terms of parliamentary democracy, Parliament was kept weak, the parties were fragmented, and there was a high level of mutual distrust. The Nazis built on the illiberal, anti-pluralist elements of Weimar's political culture. The Junker elites (the large landowners in the east) and senior civil servants used their great power and influence well into the twentieth century to frustrate any movement toward democracy. They played an especially negative role in the crisis of 1930–1933. Bismarck's emphasis on military force amplified the voice of the officer corps, which combined advanced modernisation of military technology with reactionary politics. The rising upper-middle-class elites, in the business, financial and professional worlds, tended to accept the values of the old traditional elites. The German Empire was for Hans-Ulrich Wehler a strange mixture of highly successful capitalist industrialisation and socio-economic modernisation on the one hand, and of surviving pre-industrial institutions, power relations and traditional cultures on the other. Wehler argues that it produced a high degree of internal tension, which led on the one hand to the suppression of socialists, Catholics and reformers, and on the other hand to a highly aggressive foreign policy. For these reasons Fritz Fischer and his students emphasised Germany's primary guilt for causing the First World War.</p>\n                        <p>Hans-Ulrich Wehler, a leader of the Bielefeld School of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society. Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus). The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of \"the middle class\" and \"revolution\", each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of \"charismatic domination\", which focuses heavily on Hitler.</p>\n                        <p>The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. 19th-century scholars who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the \"western path\" typified by Great Britain. They stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a social welfare state. In the 1950s, historians in West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933–1945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in German historiography: the \"long 19th century\", the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West. After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg. While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">German Empire</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Deutsches Kaiserreich</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">1871–1918</h2>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_year\">Germany: 1871–1918</h3>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_geremp.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of German Empire</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>Berlin</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">German Empire</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">People</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec03\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td>540,857.54 km<sup>2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td>UTC+1</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_geremp.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map of German Empire</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td>                       \n                            <ul>\n                                <li>41,058,792 (1871)</li>\n                                <li>56,367,178 (1900)</li>\n                                <li>64,925,993 (1910)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td>United Protestant</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Languages</th>\n                        <td>German</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>                        <ul>\n                            <li>German gold mark (1873–1914)</li>\n                            <li>German Papiermark (1914–1918)</li>\n                        </ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>                        <ul>\n                            <li>Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy (1871–1916)</li>\n                            <li>Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy under a military dictatorship (1916–1918)</li>\n                        </ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Emperor, Chancellor</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Wilhelm I (Emperor, 1871–1888)</li>\n                                <li>Friedrich III (Emperor, 1888)</li>\n                                <li>Wilhelm II (Emperor, 1888–1918)</li>\n                                <li>Otto von Bismarck (Chancellor, 1871–1890)</li>\n                                <li>Max von Baden (Chancellor, 1918)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n            </div>\n        "},{"html":"\n            <div id=\"main_content\">\n                <h1 id=\"data_title\">Weimar Republic</h1>\n                <h2 id=\"data_year\">1918–1933</h2>\n                <hr>\n                <section id=\"sec01\">\n                    <p>The Weimar Republic (German: Weimarer Republik [ˈvaɪmaʁɐ ʁepuˈbliːk] (About this soundlisten))\n                        was the German state from 1918 to 1933, as it existed as a federal constitutional republic. The\n                        state was officially the German Reich (Deutsches Reich), and was also referred to as the German\n                        Republic (Deutsche Republik). The term \"Weimar Republic\" refers to the city of Weimar, where the\n                        republic's constituent assembly first took place. In English the country was usually simply\n                        called \"Germany\"; the term \"Weimar Republic\" did not become common in English until the 1930s.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>After four years of hostilities in World War I from 1914 to 1918 with heavy losses, Germany was\n                        exhausted and sued for peace under desperate circumstances. Awareness of imminent defeat sparked\n                        revolution, the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, German surrender, and proclamation of the\n                        Weimar republic on 9 November 1918.</p>\n                    <p>From 1918 to 1923, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation,\n                        political extremism (with contending paramilitaries) as well as contentious relationships with\n                        the victors of the First World War. From 1924 to 1929, the Republic enjoyed relative stability\n                        and prosperity. Those years are sometimes called the Golden Twenties. The world-wide economic\n                        crisis beginning in October 1929 hit Germany particularly hard. High unemployment led to the\n                        collapse of the coalition government and from March 1930 various chancellors ruled through\n                        emergency powers granted by the President. This period ended with Adolf Hitler's appointment as\n                        chancellor on 30 January 1933.</p>\n                    <p>Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong, especially on the political\n                        right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty. The\n                        Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles, although it\n                        never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of\n                        the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan).\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Under the Locarno Treaties, signed in 1925, Germany moved toward normalising relations with its\n                        neighbors. Germany recognised the western borders that had been established through the\n                        Versailles Treaty, but its eastern borders remained subject to possible revisions. In 1926,\n                        Germany joined the League of Nations.</p>\n                    <p>From 1930 onwards, President Paul von Hindenburg used emergency powers to back Chancellors\n                        Heinrich Brüning, Franz von Papen and General Kurt von Schleicher. The Great Depression,\n                        exacerbated by Brüning's policy of deflation, led to a surge in unemployment.[8] On 30 January\n                        1933, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor at the head of a coalition government. Hitler's\n                        Nazi Party held two out of ten cabinet seats. Von Papen as Vice Chancellor was intended to be\n                        the \"éminence grise\" who would keep Hitler under control, using his close personal connection to\n                        Hindenburg. These intentions badly underestimated Hitler's political abilities.</p>\n                    <p>By the end of March, the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933 had used the\n                        perceived state of emergency to grant Hitler as Chancellor broad power to act outside\n                        parliamentary control, which he used to thwart constitutional governance and civil liberties.\n                        Hitler's seizure of power (Machtergreifung) thus ended the republic. Democracy collapsed, and\n                        the creation of a single-party state began the dictatorship of the Nazi era.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Name and symbols</h3>\n                    <p>The Weimar Republic is so called because the assembly that adopted its constitution met at Weimar\n                        from 6 February 1919 to 11 August 1919,[9] but this name only became mainstream after 1933.</p>\n                    <p>Between 1919 and 1933, there was no single name for the new state that gained widespread\n                        acceptance, which is the reason why the old name Deutsches Reich was officially retained,\n                        although hardly anyone used it during the Weimar period.[10] To the right of the spectrum, the\n                        politically engaged rejected the new democratic model and were appalled to see the honour of the\n                        traditional word Reich associated with it.[11] Zentrum, the Catholic Centre Party, favoured the\n                        term Deutscher Volksstaat (German People's State), while on the moderate left Chancellor\n                        Friedrich Ebert's Social Democratic Party of Germany preferred Deutsche Republik (German\n                        Republic).[11] By the mid-1920s, Deutsche Republik was used by most Germans, but for the\n                        anti-democratic right the word Republik was a painful reminder of a government structure that\n                        had been imposed by foreign statesmen, along with the relocation of the seat of power to Weimar\n                        and the expulsion of Kaiser Wilhelm in the wake of massive national humiliation.</p>\n                    <p>The first recorded mention of the term Republik von Weimar (Republic of Weimar) came during a\n                        speech delivered by Adolf Hitler at a National Socialist German Worker's Party rally in Munich\n                        on 24 February 1929. A few weeks later, the term Weimarer Republik was first used again by\n                        Hitler in a newspaper article.[10] Only during the 1930s did the term become mainstream, both\n                        within and outside Germany.</p>\n                    <p>According to historian Richard J.

The Freikorps units were formally disbanded in\n                        1920 (although continued to exist in underground groups), and on 1 January 1921, a new\n                        Reichswehr (figuratively; Defence of the realm) was created.</p>\n                    <p>The Treaty of Versailles limited the size of the Reichswehr to 100,000 soldiers (consisting of\n                        seven infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions), 10 armoured cars and a navy (the\n                        Reichsmarine) restricted to 36 ships in active service. No aircraft of any kind was allowed. The\n                        main advantage of this limitation, however, was that the Reichswehr could afford to pick the\n                        best recruits for service. However, with inefficient armour and no air support, the Reichswehr\n                        would have had limited combat abilities. Privates were mainly recruited from the countryside, as\n                        it was believed that young men from cities were prone to socialist behaviour, which would fray\n                        the loyalty of the privates to their conservative officers.</p>\n                    <p>Although technically in service of the republic, the army was predominantly officered by\n                        conservative reactionaries who were sympathetic to right-wing organisations. Hans von Seeckt,\n                        the head of the Reichswehr, declared that the army was not loyal to the democratic republic, and\n                        would only defend it if it were in their interests. During the Kapp Putsch for example, the army\n                        refused to fire upon the rebels. The vulgar and turbulent SA was the Reichswehr's main opponent\n                        throughout its existence, openly seeking to absorb the army, and the army fired at them during\n                        the Beerhall Putsch. With the ascendance of the SS, the Reichswehr took a softer line about the\n                        Nazis, as the SS presented itself as elitist, respectable, orderly, and busy reforming and\n                        dominating the police rather than the army.</p>\n                    <p>In 1935, two years after Adolf Hitler's rise to power, the Reichswehr was renamed the Wehrmacht\n                        {\"Defense Force\"}. The Wehrmacht was the unified armed forces of the Nazi regime, which\n                        consisted of the Heer (army), the Kriegsmarine (navy) and the Luftwaffe (air force).</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec04\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Background</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">November Revolution (1918–1919)</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Years of crisis (1919–1923)</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Golden Era (1924–1929)</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn05\">Renewed crisis and decline (1930–1933)</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn06\">End of the Weimar Republic</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn07\">Reasons for failure</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Background</h4>\n                        <p>Hostilities in World War I took place between 1914 and 11 November 1918, involved\n                            mobilization of 70 million military personnel and resulted in over 20 million military and\n                            civilian deaths[14] (exclusive of fatalities from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which\n                            accounted for millions more) making it one of the largest and deadliest wars in history.</p>\n                        <p>After four years of war on multiple fronts in Europe and around the world, the Allied\n                            offensive began in August 1918, and the position of Germany and the Central Powers\n                            deteriorated,[16][17] leading them to sue for peace.

On 29 October, rebellion broke out in Kiel among sailors. There,\n                            sailors, soldiers, and workers began electing Workers' and Soldiers' Councils (Arbeiter und\n                            Soldatenräte) modelled after the Soviets of the Russian Revolution of 1917. The revolution\n                            spread throughout Germany, and participants seized military and civil powers in individual\n                            cities. The power takeover was achieved everywhere without loss of life.</p>\n                        <p>At the time, the Socialist movement which represented mostly labourers was split among two\n                            major left-wing parties: the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which\n                            called for immediate peace negotiations and favoured a soviet-style command economy, and the\n                            Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) also known as \"Majority\" Social Democratic Party of\n                            Germany (MSPD), which supported the war effort and favoured a parliamentary system. The\n                            rebellion caused great fear in the establishment and in the middle classes because of the\n                            Soviet-style aspirations of the councils. To centrist and conservative citizens, the country\n                            looked to be on the verge of a communist revolution.</p>\n                        <p>By 7 November, the revolution had reached Munich, resulting in King Ludwig III of Bavaria\n                            fleeing. The MSPD decided to make use of their support at the grassroots and put themselves\n                            at the front of the movement, demanding that Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicate. When he refused,\n                            Prince Max of Baden simply announced that he had done so and frantically attempted to\n                            establish a regency under another member of the House of Hohenzollern. Gustav Noske, a\n                            self-appointed military expert in the MSPD, was sent to Kiel to prevent any further unrest\n                            and took on the task of controlling the mutinous sailors and their supporters in the Kiel\n                            barracks. The sailors and soldiers, inexperienced in matters of revolutionary combat,\n                            welcomed him as an experienced politician and allowed him to negotiate a settlement, thus\n                            defusing the initial anger of the revolutionaries in uniform.</p>\n                        <p>On 9 November 1918, the \"German Republic\" was proclaimed by MSPD member Philipp Scheidemann\n                            at the Reichstag building in Berlin, to the fury of Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the MSPD,\n                            who thought that the question of monarchy or republic should be answered by a national\n                            assembly. Two hours later, a \"Free Socialist Republic\" was proclaimed, 2 km (1.2 mi) away,\n                            at the Berliner Stadtschloss. The proclamation was issued by Karl Liebknecht, co-leader\n                            (with Rosa Luxemburg) of the communist Spartakusbund (Spartacus League), a group of a few\n                            hundred supporters of the Russian revolution that had allied itself with the USPD in 1917.\n                            In a legally questionable act, Imperial Chancellor (Reichskanzler) Prince Max of Baden\n                            transferred his powers to Friedrich Ebert, who, shattered by the monarchy's fall,\n                            reluctantly accepted. In view of the mass support for more radical reforms among the\n                            workers' councils, a coalition government called \"Council of the People's Deputies\" (Rat der\n                            Volksbeauftragten) was established, consisting of three MSPD and three USPD members. Led by\n                            Ebert for the MSPD and Hugo Haase for the USPD it sought to act as a provisional cabinet of\n                            ministers. But the power question was unanswered. Although the new government was confirmed\n                            by the Berlin worker and soldier council, it was opposed by the Spartacus League.</p>\n                        <p>On 11 November 1918, an armistice was signed at Compiègne by German representatives. It\n                            effectively ended military operations between the Allies and Germany. It amounted to German\n                            capitulation, without any concessions by the Allies; the naval blockade would continue until\n                            complete peace terms were agreed.</p>\n                        <p>From November 1918 to January 1919, Germany was governed by the \"Council of the People's\n                            Deputies\", under the leadership of Ebert and Haase. The Council issued a large number of\n                            decrees that radically shifted German policies. It introduced the eight-hour workday,\n                            domestic labour reform, works councils, agricultural labour reform, right of civil-service\n                            associations, local municipality social welfare relief (split between Reich and States) and\n                            national health insurance, reinstatement of demobilised workers, protection from arbitrary\n                            dismissal with appeal as a right, regulated wage agreement, and universal suffrage from 20\n                            years of age in all types of elections—local and national. Ebert called for a \"National\n                            Congress of Councils\" (Reichsrätekongress), which took place from 16 to 20 December 1918,\n                            and in which the MSPD had the majority. Thus, Ebert was able to institute elections for a\n                            provisional National Assembly that would be given the task of writing a democratic\n                            constitution for parliamentary government, marginalising the movement that called for a\n                            socialist republic.</p>\n                        <p>To ensure his fledgling government maintained control over the country, Ebert made an\n                            agreement with the OHL, now led by Ludendorff's successor General Wilhelm Groener. The\n                            'Ebert–Groener pact' stipulated that the government would not attempt to reform the army so\n                            long as the army swore to protect the state. On the one hand, this agreement symbolised the\n                            acceptance of the new government by the military, assuaging concern among the middle\n                            classes; on the other hand, it was thought contrary to working-class interests by left wing\n                            social democrats and communists, and was also opposed by the far right who believed\n                            democracy would make Germany weaker. The new Reichswehr armed forces, limited by the Treaty\n                            of Versailles to 100,000 army soldiers and 15,000 sailors, remained fully under the control\n                            of the German officer class, despite their nominal re-organisation.</p>\n                        <p>The Executive Council of the Workers’ and Soldiers’ Councils, a coalition that included\n                            Majority Socialists, Independent Socialists, workers, and soldiers, implemented a programme\n                            of progressive social change, introducing reforms such as the eight-hour workday, the\n                            releasing of political prisoners, the abolition of press censorship, increases in workers’\n                            old-age, sick and unemployment benefits, and the bestowing upon labour the unrestricted\n                            right to organise into unions.</p>\n                        <p>A number of other reforms were carried out in Germany during the revolutionary period. It was\n                            made harder for estates to sack workers and prevent them from leaving when they wanted to;\n                            under the Provisional Act for Agricultural Labour of 23 November 1918 the normal period of\n                            notice for management, and for most resident labourers, was set at six weeks. In addition, a\n                            supplementary directive of December 1918 specified that female (and child) workers were\n                            entitled to a fifteen-minute break if they worked between four and six hours, thirty minutes\n                            for workdays lasting six to eight hours, and one hour for longer days.[21] A decree on 23\n                            December 1918 established committees (composed of workers' representatives \"in their\n                            relation to the employer\") to safeguard the rights of workers. The right to bargain\n                            collectively was also established, while it was made obligatory \"to elect workers’\n                            committees on estates and establish conciliation committees\". A decree on 3 February 1919\n                            removed the right of employers to acquire exemption for domestic servants and agricultural\n                            workers.</p>\n                        <p>With the Verordnung of 3 February 1919, the Ebert government reintroduced the original\n                            structure of the health insurance boards according to an 1883 law, with one-third employers\n                            and two-thirds members (i.e. workers).[23] From 28 June 1919 health insurance committees\n                            became elected by workers themselves.[24] The Provisional Order of January 1919 concerning\n                            agricultural labour conditions fixed 2,900 hours as a maximum per year, distributed as\n                            eight, ten, and eleven hours per day in four-monthly periods.[25] A code of January 1919\n                            bestowed upon land-labourers the same legal rights that industrial workers enjoyed, while a\n                            bill ratified that same year obliged the States to set up agricultural settlement\n                            associations which, as noted by Volker Berghahn, \"were endowed with the priority right of\n                            purchase of farms beyond a specified size\".[26] In addition, undemocratic public\n                            institutions were abolished, involving, as noted by one writer, the disappearance \"of the\n                            Prussian Upper House, the former Prussian Lower House that had been elected in accordance\n                            with the three-class suffrage, and the municipal councils that were also elected on the\n                            class vote\".</p>\n                        <p>A rift developed between the MSPD and USPD after Ebert called upon the OHL (Supreme Army\n                            Command) for troops to put down a mutiny by a leftist military unit on 23/24 December 1918,\n                            in which members of the Volksmarinedivision (People's Army Division) had captured the city's\n                            garrison commander Otto Wels and occupied the Reichskanzlei (Reich Chancellery) where the\n                            \"Council of the People's Deputies\" was situated. The ensuing street fighting left several\n                            dead and injured on both sides. The USPD leaders were outraged by what they believed was\n                            treachery by the MSPD, which, in their view, had joined with the anti-communist military to\n                            suppress the revolution. Thus, the USPD left the \"Council of the People's Deputies\" after\n                            only seven weeks. On 30 December, the split deepened when the Communist Party of Germany\n                            (KPD) was formed out of a number of radical left-wing groups, including the left wing of the\n                            USPD and the Spartacus League group.</p>\n                        <p>In January, the Spartacus League and others in the streets of Berlin made more armed attempts\n                            to establish communism, known as the Spartacist uprising. Those attempts were put down by\n                            paramilitary Freikorps units consisting of volunteer soldiers. Bloody street fights\n                            culminated in the beating and shooting deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht after\n                            their arrests on 15 January.[28] With the affirmation of Ebert, those responsible were not\n                            tried before a court martial, leading to lenient sentences, which made Ebert unpopular among\n                            radical leftists.</p>\n                        <p>The National Assembly elections took place on 19 January 1919. In this time, the radical\n                            left-wing parties, including the USPD and KPD, were barely able to get themselves organised,\n                            leading to a solid majority of seats for the MSPD moderate forces. To avoid the ongoing\n                            fights in Berlin, the National Assembly convened in the city of Weimar, giving the future\n                            Republic its unofficial name. The Weimar Constitution created a republic under a\n                            parliamentary republic system with the Reichstag elected by proportional representation. The\n                            democratic parties obtained a solid 80% of the vote.</p>\n                        <p>During the debates in Weimar, fighting continued. A Soviet republic was declared in Munich,\n                            but was quickly put down by Freikorps and remnants of the regular army. The fall of the\n                            Munich Soviet Republic to these units, many of which were situated on the extreme right,\n                            resulted in the growth of far-right movements and organisations in Bavaria, including\n                            Organisation Consul, the Nazi Party, and societies of exiled Russian Monarchists. Sporadic\n                            fighting continued to flare up around the country. In eastern provinces, forces loyal to\n                            Germany's fallen Monarchy fought the republic, while militias of Polish nationalists fought\n                            for independence: Great Poland Uprising in Provinz Posen and three Silesian uprisings in\n                            Upper Silesia.</p>\n                        <p>Germany lost the war because the country ran out of allies and its economic resources were\n                            running out; support among the population began to crumble in 1916 and by mid-1918 there was\n                            support for the war only among the die-hard monarchists and conservatives. The decisive blow\n                            came with the entry of the United States into the conflict, which made its vast industrial\n                            resources available to the beleaguered Allies. By late summer 1918 the German reserves were\n                            exhausted while fresh American troops arrived in France at the rate of 10,000 a day. Retreat\n                            and defeat were at hand, and the Army told the Kaiser to abdicate for it could no longer\n                            support him. Although in retreat, the German armies were still on French and Belgian\n                            territory when the war ended on 11 November. Ludendorf and Hindenburg soon proclaimed that\n                            it was the defeatism of the civilian population that had made defeat inevitable. The\n                            die-hard nationalists then blamed the civilians for betraying the army and the surrender.\n                            This was the \"stab-in-the-back myth\" that was unceasingly propagated by the right in the\n                            1920s and ensured that many monarchists and conservatives would refuse to support the\n                            government of what they called the \"November criminals\".</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Years of crisis (1919–1923)</h4>\n                        <h5>Burden from the First World War</h5>\n                        <p>In the four years following the First World War, the situation for German civilians remained\n                            dire. The severe food shortages improved little to none up until 1923. Many German civilians\n                            expected life to return to prewar normality following the removal of the naval blockade in\n                            June 1919. Instead, the struggles induced by the First World War persisted for the decade\n                            following. Throughout the war German officials made rash decisions to combat the growing\n                            hunger of the nation, most of which were highly unsuccessful. Examples include the\n                            nationwide pig slaughter, Schweinemord, in 1915. The rationale behind exterminating the\n                            population of swine was to decrease the use of potatoes and turnips for animal consumption,\n                            transitioning all foods toward human consumption.</p>\n                        <p>In 1922, now three years after the German signing of the Treaty of Versailles, meat\n                            consumption in the country had not increased since the war era. 22 kg per person per year\n                            was still less than half of the 52 kg statistic in 1913, before the onset of the war. German\n                            citizens felt the food shortages even deeper than during the war, because the reality of the\n                            nation contrasted so starkly with their expectations. The burdens of the First World War\n                            lightened little in the immediate years following, and with the onset of the Treaty of\n                            Versailles, coupled by mass inflation, Germany still remained in a crisis. The continuity of\n                            pain showed the Weimar authority in a negative light, and public opinion was one of the main\n                            sources behind its failure.</p>\n                        <h5>Treaty of Versailles</h5>\n                        <p>The growing post-war economic crisis was a result of lost pre-war industrial exports, the\n                            loss of supplies in raw materials and foodstuffs due to the continental blockade, the loss\n                            of the colonies, and worsening debt balances, exacerbated by an exorbitant issue of\n                            promissory notes raising money to pay for the war. Military-industrial activity had almost\n                            ceased, although controlled demobilisation kept unemployment at around one million. In part,\n                            the economic losses can also be attributed to the Allied blockade of Germany until the\n                            Treaty of Versailles.</p>\n                        <p>The Allies permitted only low import levels of goods that most Germans could not\n                            afford.[citation needed] After four years of war and famine, many German workers were\n                            exhausted, physically impaired and discouraged. Millions were disenchanted with what they\n                            considered capitalism and hoping for a new era. Meanwhile, the currency depreciated, and\n                            would continue to depreciate following the French invasion of the Ruhr.</p>\n                        <p>The treaty was signed 28 June 1919 and is easily divided into four categories: territorial\n                            issues, disarmament demands, reparations, and assignment of guilt. The German colonial\n                            empire was stripped and given over to Allied forces. The greater blow to Germans however was\n                            that they were forced to give up the territory of Alsace-Lorraine. Many German borderlands\n                            were demilitarised and allowed to self-determine. The German military was forced to have no\n                            more than 100,000 men with only 4,000 officers. Germany was forced to destroy all its\n                            fortifications in the West and was prohibited from having an air force, tanks, poison gas,\n                            and heavy artillery. Many ships were scuttled and submarines and dreadnoughts were\n                            prohibited. Germany was forced under Article 235 to pay 20 billion gold marks, about 4.5\n                            billion dollars by 1921. Article 231 placed Germany and her allies with responsibility for\n                            causing all the loss and damage suffered by the Allies. While Article 235 angered many\n                            Germans, no part of the treaty was more fought over than Article 231.</p>\n                        <p>The German peace delegation in France signed the Treaty of Versailles, accepting mass\n                            reductions of the German military, the prospect of substantial war reparations payments to\n                            the victorious allies, and the controversial \"War Guilt Clause\". Explaining the rise of\n                            extreme nationalist movements in Germany shortly after the war, British historian Ian\n                            Kershaw points to the \"national disgrace\" that was \"felt throughout Germany at the\n                            humiliating terms imposed by the victorious Allies and reflected in the Versailles\n                            Treaty...with its confiscation of territory on the eastern border and even more so its\n                            'guilt clause'.\"[33] Adolf Hitler repeatedly blamed the republic and its democracy for\n                            accepting the oppressive terms of this treaty. The Republic's first Reichspräsident (\"Reich\n                            President\"), Friedrich Ebert of the SPD, signed the new German constitution into law on 11\n                            August 1919.</p>\n                        <p>The new post-World War Germany, stripped of all colonies, became 13% smaller in its European\n                            territory than its imperial predecessor. Of these losses, a large proportion consisted of\n                            provinces that were originally Polish, and Alsace-Lorraine, seized by Germany in 1870, where\n                            Germans constituted only part or a minority of local populations despite nationalist outrage\n                            at the fragmentation of Germany.</p>\n                        <h5>Allied Rhineland occupation</h5>\n                        <p>The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice with Germany of 11\n                            November 1918. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French\n                            forces.</p>\n                        <p>In 1920, under massive French pressure, the Saar was separated from the Rhine Province and\n                            administered by the League of Nations until a plebiscite in 1935, when the region was\n                            returned to the Deutsches Reich. At the same time, in 1920, the districts of Eupen and\n                            Malmedy were transferred to Belgium (see German-Speaking Community of Belgium). Shortly\n                            after, France completely occupied the Rhineland, strictly controlling all important\n                            industrial areas.</p>\n                        <h5>Reparations</h5>\n                        <p>The actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion\n                            marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 billion marks stipulated in\n                            the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in \"C bonds\" were\n                            entirely chimerical—a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more.\n                            The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20\n                            billion German gold marks, worth about US$5 billion or £1 billion British pounds. 12.5\n                            billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods such\n                            as coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed\n                            in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The\n                            highly publicised rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans'\n                            benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their\n                            share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US\n                            Treasury received $100 million.</p>\n                        <h5>Hyperinflation</h5>\n                        <p>In the early post-war years, inflation was growing at an alarming rate, but the government\n                            simply printed more currency to pay debts. By 1923, the Republic claimed it could no longer\n                            afford the reparations payments required by the Versailles Treaty, and the government\n                            defaulted on some payments. In response, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr region,\n                            Germany's most productive industrial region at the time, taking control of most mining and\n                            manufacturing companies in January 1923. Strikes were called, and passive resistance was\n                            encouraged. These strikes lasted eight months, further damaging both the economy and\n                            society.</p>\n                        <p>The strike prevented some goods from being produced, but one industrialist, Hugo Stinnes, was\n                            able to create a vast empire out of bankrupt companies. Because the production costs in\n                            Germany were falling almost hourly, the prices for German products were unbeatable. Stinnes\n                            made sure that he was paid in dollars, which meant that by mid-1923, his industrial empire\n                            was worth more than the entire German economy. By the end of the year, over two hundred\n                            factories were working full-time to produce paper for the spiralling bank note production.\n                            Stinnes' empire collapsed when the government-sponsored inflation was stopped in November\n                            1923.</p>\n                        <p>In 1919, one loaf of bread cost 1 mark; by 1923, the same loaf of bread cost 100 billion\n                            marks.</p>\n                        <p>Since striking workers were paid benefits by the state, much additional currency was printed,\n                            fuelling a period of hyperinflation. The 1920s German inflation started when Germany had no\n                            goods to trade. The government printed money to deal with the crisis; this meant payments\n                            within Germany were made with worthless paper money, and helped formerly great\n                            industrialists to pay back their own loans. This also led to pay raises for workers and for\n                            businessmen who wanted to profit from it. Circulation of money rocketed, and soon banknotes\n                            were being overprinted to a thousand times their nominal value and every town produced its\n                            own promissory notes; many banks and industrial firms did the same.</p>\n                        <p>The value of the Papiermark had declined from 4.2 marks per U.S. dollar in 1914 to one\n                            million per dollar by August 1923. This led to further criticism of the Republic. On 15\n                            November 1923, a new currency, the Rentenmark, was introduced at the rate of one trillion\n                            (1,000,000,000,000) Papiermark for one Rentenmark, an action known as redenomination. At\n                            that time, one U.S. dollar was equal to 4.2 Rentenmark. Reparation payments were resumed,\n                            and the Ruhr was returned to Germany under the Locarno Treaties, which defined the borders\n                            between Germany, France, and Belgium.</p>\n                        <h5>Political turmoil</h5>\n                        <p>The Republic was soon under attack from both left- and right-wing sources. The radical left\n                            accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers' movement\n                            by preventing a communist revolution and sought to overthrow the Republic and do so\n                            themselves. Various right-wing sources opposed any democratic system, preferring an\n                            authoritarian monarchy like the German Empire. To further undermine the Republic's\n                            credibility, some right-wingers (especially certain members of the former officer corps)\n                            also blamed an alleged conspiracy of Socialists and Jews for Germany's defeat in the First\n                            World War.</p>\n                        <p>In the next five years, the central government, assured of the support of the Reichswehr,\n                            dealt severely with the occasional outbreaks of violence in Germany's large cities. The left\n                            claimed that the Social Democrats had betrayed the ideals of the revolution, while the army\n                            and the government-financed Freikorps committed hundreds of acts of gratuitous violence\n                            against striking workers.</p>\n                        <p>The first challenge to the Weimar Republic came when a group of communists and anarchists\n                            took over the Bavarian government in Munich and declared the creation of the Bavarian Soviet\n                            Republic. The uprising was brutally attacked by Freikorps, which consisted mainly of\n                            ex-soldiers dismissed from the army and who were well-paid to put down forces of the Far\n                            Left. The Freikorps was an army outside the control of the government, but they were in\n                            close contact with their allies in the Reichswehr.</p>\n                        <p>On 13 March 1920 during the Kapp Putsch, 12,000 Freikorps soldiers occupied Berlin and\n                            installed Wolfgang Kapp, a right-wing journalist, as chancellor. The national government\n                            fled to Stuttgart and called for a general strike against the putsch. The strike meant that\n                            no \"official\" pronouncements could be published, and with the civil service out on strike,\n                            the Kapp government collapsed after only four days on 17 March.</p>\n                        <p>Inspired by the general strikes, a workers' uprising began in the Ruhr region when 50,000\n                            people formed a \"Red Army\" and took control of the province. The regular army and the\n                            Freikorps ended the uprising on their own authority. The rebels were campaigning for an\n                            extension of the plans to nationalise major industries and supported the national\n                            government, but the SPD leaders did not want to lend support to the growing USPD, who\n                            favoured the establishment of a socialist regime. The repression of an uprising of SPD\n                            supporters by the reactionary forces in the Freikorps on the instructions of the SPD\n                            ministers was to become a major source of conflict within the socialist movement and thus\n                            contributed to the weakening of the only group that could have withstood the Nazi movement.\n                            Other rebellions were put down in March 1921 in Saxony and Hamburg.</p>\n                        <p>One of the manifestations of the sharp political polarization that had occurred were the\n                            right-wing motivated assassinations of important representatives of the young republic. In\n                            August 1921, Finance Minister Matthias Erzberger and Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau[c]\n                            were murdered by members of the Organization Consul. in June 1922, who had been defamed as\n                            compliant \"Erfüllungspolitiker\" [de][d] with regard to the Treaty of Versailles. While\n                            Erzberger was attacked for signing the armistice agreement in 1918, Rathenau as foreign\n                            minister was responsible, among other things, for the reparations issue. He had also sought\n                            to break Germany's isolation after World War I through the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo with the\n                            Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. However, he also drew right-wing extremist\n                            hatred as a Jew (see also Weimar antisemitism). The solidarity expressed in large, public\n                            funeral processions for those murdered, and the passage of a \"Law for the Defense of the\n                            Republic,\" [de][e] were intended to put a stop to the right-wing enemies of the Weimar\n                            Republic. However, right-wing state criminals were not permanently deterred from their\n                            activities, and the lenient sentences they were given by judges influenced by imperial\n                            conservatism were a contributing factor.</p>\n                        <p>In 1922, Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo with the Soviet Union, which allowed Germany to\n                            train military personnel in exchange for giving Russia military technology. This was against\n                            the Treaty of Versailles, which limited Germany to 100,000 soldiers and no conscription,\n                            naval forces of 15,000 men, twelve destroyers, six battleships, and six cruisers, no\n                            submarines or aircraft. However, Russia had pulled out of the First World War against the\n                            Germans as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, and was excluded from the League of\n                            Nations. Thus, Germany seized the chance to make an ally. Walther Rathenau, the Jewish\n                            Foreign Minister who signed the treaty, was assassinated two months later by two\n                            ultra-nationalist army officers.</p>\n                        <p>Further pressure from the political right came in 1923 with the Beer Hall Putsch, also called\n                            the Munich Putsch, staged by the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler in Munich. In 1920, the\n                            German Workers' Party had become the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), or\n                            Nazi party, and would become a driving force in the collapse of Weimar. Hitler named himself\n                            as chairman of the party in July 1921. On 8 November 1923, the Kampfbund, in a pact with\n                            Erich Ludendorff, took over a meeting by Bavarian prime minister Gustav von Kahr at a beer\n                            hall in Munich.</p>\n                        <p>Ludendorff and Hitler declared that the Weimar government was deposed and that they were\n                            planning to take control of Munich the following day. The 3,000 rebels were thwarted by the\n                            Bavarian authorities. Hitler was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for high\n                            treason, a minimum sentence for the charge. Hitler served less than eight months in a\n                            comfortable cell, receiving a daily stream of visitors before his release on 20 December\n                            1924. While in jail, Hitler dictated Mein Kampf, which laid out his ideas and future\n                            policies. Hitler now decided to focus on legal methods of gaining power.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Golden Era (1924–1929)</h4>\n                        <p>Gustav Stresemann was Reichskanzler for 100 days in 1923, and served as foreign minister from\n                            1923 to 1929, a period of relative stability for the Weimar Republic, known in Germany as\n                            Goldene Zwanziger (\"Golden Twenties\"). Prominent features of this period were a growing\n                            economy and a consequent decrease in civil unrest.</p>\n                        <p>Once civil stability had been restored, Stresemann began stabilising the German currency,\n                            which promoted confidence in the German economy and helped the recovery that was so greatly\n                            needed for the German nation to keep up with their reparation repayments, while at the same\n                            time feeding and supplying the nation.</p>\n                        <p>Once the economic situation had stabilised, Stresemann could begin putting a permanent\n                            currency in place, called the Rentenmark (October 1923), which again contributed to the\n                            growing level of international confidence in the Weimar Republic's economy.</p>\n                        <p>To help Germany meet reparation obligations, the Dawes Plan was created in 1924. This was an\n                            agreement between American banks and the German government in which the American banks lent\n                            money to German banks with German assets as collateral to help it pay reparations. The\n                            German railways, the National Bank and many industries were therefore mortgaged as\n                            securities for the stable currency and the loans.</p>\n                        <p>Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Union.\n                            Under the Treaty of Rapallo, Germany accorded it formal (de jure) recognition, and the two\n                            mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims. In October 1925 the Treaty of\n                            Locarno was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's\n                            borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist\n                            France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno\n                            paved the way for Germany's admission to the League of Nations in 1926.[39] Germany signed\n                            arbitration conventions with France and Belgium and arbitration treaties with Poland and\n                            Czechoslovakia, undertaking to refer any future disputes to an arbitration tribunal or to\n                            the Permanent Court of International Justice. Other foreign achievements were the evacuation\n                            of foreign troops from the Ruhr in 1925. In 1926, Germany was admitted to the League of\n                            Nations as a permanent member, improving her international standing and giving the right to\n                            vote on League matters.</p>\n                        <p>Overall trade increased and unemployment fell. Stresemann's reforms did not relieve the\n                            underlying weaknesses of Weimar but gave the appearance of a stable democracy. Even\n                            Stresemann's 'German People's party' failed to gain nationwide recognition, and instead\n                            featured in the 'flip-flop' coalitions. The Grand Coalition headed by Muller inspired some\n                            faith in the government, but that didn't last. Governments frequently lasted only a year,\n                            comparable to the political situation in France during the 1930s. The major weakness in\n                            constitutional terms was the inherent instability of the coalitions, which often fell prior\n                            to elections. The growing dependence on American finance was to prove fleeting, and Germany\n                            was one of the worst hit nations in the Great Depression.</p>\n                        <h5>Culture</h5>\n                        <p>The 1920s saw a remarkable cultural renaissance in Germany. During the worst phase of\n                            hyperinflation in 1923, the clubs and bars were full of speculators who spent their daily\n                            profits so they would not lose the value the following day. Berlin intellectuals responded\n                            by condemning the excesses of what they considered capitalism, and demanding revolutionary\n                            changes on the cultural scenery.</p>\n                        <p>Influenced by the brief cultural explosion in the Soviet Union, German literature, cinema,\n                            theatre and musical works entered a phase of great creativity. Innovative street theatre\n                            brought plays to the public, and the cabaret scene and jazz band became very popular.\n                            According to the cliché, modern young women were Americanised, wearing makeup, short hair,\n                            smoking and breaking with traditional mores. The euphoria surrounding Josephine Baker in the\n                            metropolis of Berlin for instance, where she was declared an \"erotic goddess\" and in many\n                            ways admired and respected, kindled further \"ultramodern\" sensations in the minds of the\n                            German public.[40] Art and a new type of architecture taught at \"Bauhaus\" schools reflected\n                            the new ideas of the time, with artists such as George Grosz being fined for defaming the\n                            military and for blasphemy.</p>\n                        <p>Artists in Berlin were influenced by other contemporary progressive cultural movements, such\n                            as the Impressionist and Expressionist painters in Paris, as well as the Cubists. Likewise,\n                            American progressive architects were admired. Many of the new buildings built during this\n                            era followed a straight-lined, geometrical style. Examples of the new architecture include\n                            the Bauhaus Building by Gropius, Grosses Schauspielhaus, and the Einstein Tower.</p>\n                        <p>Not everyone, however, was happy with the changes taking place in Weimar culture.\n                            Conservatives and reactionaries feared that Germany was betraying its traditional values by\n                            adopting popular styles from abroad, particularly those Hollywood was popularising in\n                            American films, while New York became the global capital of fashion. Germany was more\n                            susceptible to Americanization, because of the close economic links brought about by the\n                            Dawes plan.</p>\n                        <p>In 1929, three years after receiving the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize, Stresemann died of a heart\n                            attack at age 51. When the New York Stock Exchange crashed in October 1929, American loans\n                            dried up and the sharp decline of the German economy brought the \"Golden Twenties\" to an\n                            abrupt end.</p>\n                        <h5>Socual policy under Weimar</h5>\n                        <p>A wide range of progressive social reforms were carried out during and after the\n                            revolutionary period. In 1919, legislation provided for a maximum working 48-hour workweek,\n                            restrictions on night work, a half-holiday on Saturday, and a break of thirty-six hours of\n                            continuous rest during the week.[42] That same year, health insurance was extended to wives\n                            and daughters without their own income, people only partially capable of gainful employment,\n                            people employed in private cooperatives, and people employed in public cooperatives.[43] A\n                            series of progressive tax reforms were introduced under the auspices of Matthias Erzberger,\n                            including increases in taxes on capital[44] and an increase in the highest income tax rate\n                            from 4% to 60%.[45] Under a governmental decree of 3 February 1919, the German government\n                            met the demand of the veterans' associations that all aid for the disabled and their\n                            dependents be taken over by the central government[46] (thus assuming responsibility for\n                            this assistance) and extended into peacetime the nationwide network of state and district\n                            welfare bureaus that had been set up during the war to coordinate social services for war\n                            widows and orphans.</p>\n                        <p>The Imperial Youth Welfare Act of 1922 obliged all municipalities and states to set up youth\n                            offices in charge of child protection, and also codified a right to education for all\n                            children,[48] while laws were passed to regulate rents and increase protection for tenants\n                            in 1922 and 1923.[49] Health insurance coverage was extended to other categories of the\n                            population during the existence of the Weimar Republic, including seamen, people employed in\n                            the educational and social welfare sectors, and all primary dependents.[43] Various\n                            improvements were also made in unemployment benefits, although in June 1920 the maximum\n                            amount of unemployment benefit that a family of four could receive in Berlin, 90 marks, was\n                            well below the minimum cost of subsistence of 304 marks.</p>\n                        <p>In 1923, unemployment relief was consolidated into a regular programme of assistance\n                            following economic problems that year. In 1924, a modern public assistance programme was\n                            introduced, and in 1925 the accident insurance programme was reformed, allowing diseases\n                            that were linked to certain kinds of work to become insurable risks. In addition, a national\n                            unemployment insurance programme was introduced in 1927.[51] Housing construction was also\n                            greatly accelerated during the Weimar period, with over 2 million new homes constructed\n                            between 1924 and 1931 and a further 195,000 modernised.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Renewed crisis and decline (1930–1933)</h4>\n                        <h5>Onset of the Great Depression</h5>\n                        <p>In 1929, the onset of the depression in the United States of America produced a severe\n                            economic shock in Germany and was further made worse by the bankruptcy of the Austrian\n                            Creditanstalt bank. Germany's fragile economy had been sustained by the granting of loans\n                            through the Dawes Plan (1924) and the Young Plan (1929). When American banks withdrew their\n                            line of credit to German companies, the onset of severe unemployment could not be abated by\n                            conventional economic measures. Unemployment thereafter grew dramatically, at 4 million in\n                            1930,[54] and in September 1930 a political earthquake shook the republic to its\n                            foundations. The Nazi Party (NSDAP) entered the Reichstag with 19% of the popular vote and\n                            made the unstable coalition system by which every chancellor had governed increasingly\n                            unworkable. The last years of the Weimar Republic was marred by even more systemic political\n                            instability than in the previous years as political violence increased. Four Chancellors\n                            Brüning, Papen, Schleicher and, from 30 January to 23 March 1933, Hitler governed through\n                            presidential decree rather than through parliamentary consultation. This effectively\n                            rendered parliament as a means of enforcing constitutional checks and balances powerless.\n                        </p>\n                        <h5>Brüning's policy of deflation (1930–1932)</h5>\n                        <p>On 29 March 1930, after months of lobbying by General Kurt von Schleicher on behalf of the\n                            military, the finance expert Heinrich Brüning was appointed as Müller's successor by\n                            Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg. The new government was expected to lead a political\n                            shift towards conservatism.</p>\n                        <p>As Brüning had no majority support in the Reichstag, he became, through the use of the\n                            emergency powers granted to the Reichspräsident (Article 48) by the constitution, the first\n                            Weimar chancellor to operate independently of parliament. This made him dependent on the\n                            Reichspräsident, Hindenburg.[5] After a bill to reform the Reich's finances was opposed by\n                            the Reichstag, it was made an emergency decree by Hindenburg. On 18 July, as a result of\n                            opposition from the SPD, KPD, DNVP and the small contingent of NSDAP members, the Reichstag\n                            again rejected the bill by a slim margin. Immediately afterward, Brüning submitted the\n                            president's decree that the Reichstag be dissolved. The consequent general election on 14\n                            September resulted in an enormous political shift within the Reichstag: 18.3% of the vote\n                            went to the NSDAP, five times the percentage won in 1928. As a result, it was no longer\n                            possible to form a pro-republican majority, not even with a grand coalition that excluded\n                            the KPD, DNVP and NSDAP. This encouraged an escalation in the number of public\n                            demonstrations and instances of paramilitary violence organised by the NSDAP.</p>\n                        <p>Between 1930 and 1932, Brüning tried to reform the Weimar Republic without a parliamentary\n                            majority, governing, when necessary, through the President's emergency decrees. In line with\n                            the contemporary economic theory (subsequently termed \"leave-it-alone liquidationism\"), he\n                            enacted a draconian policy of deflation and drastically cutting state expenditure.[5] Among\n                            other measures, he completely halted all public grants to the obligatory unemployment\n                            insurance introduced in 1927, resulting in workers making higher contributions and fewer\n                            benefits for the unemployed. Benefits for the sick, invalid and pensioners were also reduced\n                            sharply.[55] Additional difficulties were caused by the different deflationary policies\n                            pursued by Brüning and the Reichsbank, Germany's central bank.[56] In mid-1931, the United\n                            Kingdom abandoned the gold standard and about 30 countries (the sterling bloc) devalued\n                            their currencies,[57] making their goods around 20% cheaper than those produced by\n                            Germany.[clarification needed] As the Young Plan did not allow a devaluation of the\n                            Reichsmark, Brüning triggered a deflationary internal devaluation by forcing the economy to\n                            reduce prices, rents, salaries and wages by 20%.[8] Debate continues as to whether this\n                            policy was without alternative: some argue that the Allies would not in any circumstances\n                            have allowed a devaluation of the Reichsmark, while others point to the Hoover Moratorium as\n                            a sign that the Allies understood that the situation had changed fundamentally and further\n                            German reparation payments were impossible. Brüning expected that the policy of deflation\n                            would temporarily worsen the economic situation before it began to improve, quickly\n                            increasing the German economy's competitiveness and then restoring its creditworthiness. His\n                            long-term view was that deflation would, in any case, be the best way to help the economy.\n                            His primary goal was to remove Germany's reparation payments by convincing the Allies that\n                            they could no longer be paid.[58] Anton Erkelenz, chairman of the German Democratic Party\n                            and a contemporary critic of Brüning, famously said that the policy of deflation is:</p>\n                        <p style=\"font-style: italic;\">A rightful attempt to release Germany from the grip of reparation\n                            payments, but in reality it meant nothing else than committing suicide because of fearing\n                            death. The deflation policy causes much more damage than the reparation payments of 20 years\n                            ... Fighting against Hitler is fighting against deflation, the enormous destruction of\n                            production factors.</p>\n                        <p>In 1933, the American economist Irving Fisher developed the theory of debt deflation. He\n                            explained that a deflation causes a decline of profits, asset prices and a still greater\n                            decline in the net worth of businesses. Even healthy companies, therefore, may appear\n                            over-indebted and facing bankruptcy.[60] The consensus today is that Brüning's policies\n                            exacerbated the German economic crisis and the population's growing frustration with\n                            democracy, contributing enormously to the increase in support for Hitler's NSDAP.</p>\n                        <p>Most German capitalists and landowners originally supported the conservative experiment more\n                            from the belief that conservatives would best serve their interests rather than any\n                            particular liking for Brüning. As more of the working and middle classes turned against\n                            Brüning, however, more of the capitalists and landowners declared themselves in favour of\n                            his opponents Hitler and Hugenberg. By late 1931, the conservative movement was dead and\n                            Hindenburg and the Reichswehr had begun to contemplate dropping Brüning in favour of\n                            accommodating Hugenberg and Hitler. Although Hindenburg disliked Hugenberg and despised\n                            Hitler, he was no less a supporter of the sort of anti-democratic counter-revolution that\n                            the DNVP and NSDAP represented.[61] In April 1932, Brüning had actively supported\n                            Hindenburg's successful campaign against Hitler for re-election as Reichspräsident;[62] five\n                            weeks later, on 20 May 1932, he had lost Hindenburg's support and duly resigned as\n                            Reichskanzler.</p>\n                        <h5>Papen deal</h5>\n                        <p>Hindenburg then appointed Franz von Papen as new Reichskanzler. Papen lifted the ban on the\n                            NSDAP's SA paramilitary, imposed after the street riots, in an unsuccessful attempt to\n                            secure the backing of Hitler.</p>\n                        <p>Papen was closely associated with the industrialist and land-owning classes and pursued an\n                            extremely conservative policy along Hindenburg's lines. He appointed as Reichswehr Minister\n                            Kurt von Schleicher, and all the members of the new cabinet were of the same political\n                            opinion as Hindenburg. The government was expected to assure itself of the co-operation of\n                            Hitler. Since the republicans were not yet ready to take action, the Communists did not want\n                            to support the republic and the conservatives had shot their political bolt, Hitler and\n                            Hugenberg were certain to achieve power.</p>\n                        <h5>Elections of July 1932</h5>\n                        <p>Because most parties opposed the new government, Papen had the Reichstag dissolved and called\n                            for new elections. The general elections on 31 July 1932 yielded major gains for the\n                            Communists, and for the Nazis, who won 37.3% of the vote—their high-water mark in a free\n                            election. The Nazi party then supplanted the Social Democrats as the largest party in the\n                            Reichstag, although it did not gain a majority.</p>\n                        <p>The immediate question was what part the now large Nazi Party would play in the Government of\n                            the country. The party owed its huge increase to growing support from middle-class people,\n                            whose traditional parties were swallowed up by the Nazi Party. The millions of radical\n                            adherents at first forced the Party towards the Left. They wanted a renewed Germany and a\n                            new organisation of German society. The left of the Nazi party strove desperately against\n                            any drift into the train of such capitalist and feudal reactionaries. Therefore, Hitler\n                            refused ministry under Papen, and demanded the chancellorship for himself, but was rejected\n                            by Hindenburg on 13 August 1932. There was still no majority in the Reichstag for any\n                            government; as a result, the Reichstag was dissolved and elections took place once more in\n                            the hope that a stable majority would result.</p>\n                        <h5>Schleicher cabinet</h5>\n                        <p>The 6 November 1932 elections yielded 33% for the Nazis,[63] two million voters fewer than in\n                            the previous election. Franz von Papen stepped down and was succeeded as Chancellor\n                            (Reichskanzler) by General Kurt von Schleicher on 3 December. Schleicher, a retired army\n                            officer, had developed in an atmosphere of semi-obscurity and intrigue that encompassed the\n                            Republican military policy. He had for years been in the camp of those supporting the\n                            Conservative counter-revolution. Schleicher's bold and unsuccessful plan was to build a\n                            majority in the Reichstag by uniting the trade unionist left wings of the various parties,\n                            including that of the Nazis led by Gregor Strasser. This policy did not prove successful\n                            either.</p>\n                        <p>In this brief Presidential Dictatorship intermission, Schleicher assumed the role of\n                            \"Socialist General\" and entered into relations with the Christian Trade Unions, the\n                            relatively left of the Nazi party, and even with the Social Democrats. Schleicher planned\n                            for a sort of labour government under his Generalship. But the Reichswehr officers were not\n                            prepared for this, the working class had a natural distrust of their future allies, and the\n                            great capitalists and landowners also did not like the plans.</p>\n                        <p>Hitler learned from Papen that the general had not received from Hindenburg the authority to\n                            abolish the Reichstag parliament, whereas any majority of seats did. The cabinet (under a\n                            previous interpretation of Article 48) ruled without a sitting Reichstag, which could vote\n                            only for its own dissolution. Hitler also learned that all past crippling Nazi debts were to\n                            be relieved by German big business.</p>\n                        <p>On 22 January, Hitler's efforts to persuade Oskar von Hindenburg, the President's son and\n                            confidant, included threats to bring criminal charges over estate taxation irregularities at\n                            the President's Neudeck estate; although 5,000 acres (20 km2) extra were soon allotted to\n                            Hindenburg's property. Outmaneuvered by Papen and Hitler on plans for the new cabinet, and\n                            having lost Hindenburg's confidence, Schleicher asked for new elections. On 28 January,\n                            Papen described Hitler to Paul von Hindenburg as only a minority part of an alternative,\n                            Papen-arranged government. The four great political movements, the SPD, Communists, Centre,\n                            and the Nazis were in opposition.</p>\n                        <p>On 29 January, Hitler and Papen thwarted a last-minute threat of an officially sanctioned\n                            Reichswehr takeover, and on 30 January 1933 Hindenburg accepted the new\n                            Papen-Nationalist-Hitler coalition, with the Nazis holding only three of eleven Cabinet\n                            seats: Hitler as Chancellor, Wilhelm Frick as Minister of the Interior and Hermann Göring as\n                            Minister Without Portfolio. Later that day, the first cabinet meeting was attended by only\n                            two political parties, representing a minority in the Reichstag: The Nazis and the German\n                            National People's Party (DNVP), led by Alfred Hugenberg, with 196 and 52 seats respectively.\n                            Eyeing the Catholic Centre Party's 70 (plus 20 BVP) seats, Hitler refused their leader's\n                            demands for constitutional \"concessions\" (amounting to protection) and planned for\n                            dissolution of the Reichstag.</p>\n                        <p>Hindenburg, despite his misgivings about the Nazis' goals and about Hitler as a personality,\n                            reluctantly agreed to Papen's theory that, with Nazi popular support on the wane, Hitler\n                            could now be controlled as Chancellor. This date, dubbed by the Nazis as the Machtergreifung\n                            (seizure of power), is commonly seen as the beginning of Nazi Germany.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>End of the Weimar Republic</h4>\n                        <h5>Hitler's chancellorship (1933)</h5>\n                        <p>Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor on the morning of 30 January 1933 in what some observers\n                            later described as a brief and indifferent ceremony. By early February, a mere week after\n                            Hitler's assumption of the chancellorship, the government had begun to clamp down on the\n                            opposition. Meetings of the left-wing parties were banned and even some of the moderate\n                            parties found their members threatened and assaulted. Measures with an appearance of\n                            legality suppressed the Communist Party in mid-February and included the plainly illegal\n                            arrests of Reichstag deputies.</p>\n                        <p>The Reichstag fire on 27 February was blamed by Hitler's government on the Communists. Hitler\n                            used the ensuing state of emergency to obtain the presidential assent of Hindenburg to issue\n                            the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day. The decree invoked Article 48 of the Weimar\n                            Constitution and \"indefinitely suspended\" a number of constitutional protections of civil\n                            liberties, allowing the Nazi government to take swift action against political meetings,\n                            arresting and killing the Communists.</p>\n                        <p>Hitler and the Nazis exploited the German state's broadcasting and aviation facilities in a\n                            massive attempt to sway the electorate, but this election yielded a scant majority of 16\n                            seats for the coalition. At the Reichstag elections, which took place on 5 March 1933, the\n                            NSDAP obtained 17 million votes. The Communist, Social Democrat and Catholic Centre votes\n                            stood firm. This was the last multi-party election of the Weimar Republic and the last\n                            multi-party all-German election for 57 years.</p>\n                        <p>Hitler addressed disparate interest groups, stressing the necessity for a definitive solution\n                            to the perpetual instability of the Weimar Republic. He now blamed Germany's problems on the\n                            Communists, even threatening their lives on 3 March. Former Chancellor Heinrich Brüning\n                            proclaimed that his Centre Party would resist any constitutional change and appealed to the\n                            President for an investigation of the Reichstag fire. Hitler's successful plan was to induce\n                            what remained of the now Communist-depleted Reichstag to grant him, and the Government, the\n                            authority to issue decrees with the force of law. The hitherto Presidential Dictatorship\n                            hereby was to give itself a new legal form.</p>\n                        <p>On 15 March, the first cabinet meeting was attended by the two coalition parties,\n                            representing a minority in the Reichstag: The Nazis and the DNVP led by Alfred Hugenberg\n                            (288 + 52 seats). According to the Nuremberg Trials, this cabinet meeting's first order of\n                            business was how at last to achieve the complete counter-revolution by means of the\n                            constitutionally allowed Enabling Act, requiring a 66% parliamentary majority. This Act\n                            would, and did, lead Hitler and the NSDAP toward his goal of unfettered dictatorial powers.\n                        </p>\n                        <h5>Hitler cabinet meeting in mid-March</h5>\n                        <p>At the cabinet meeting on 15 March, Hitler introduced the Enabling Act, which would have\n                            authorised the cabinet to enact legislation without the approval of the Reichstag.\n                            Meanwhile, the only remaining question for the Nazis was whether the Catholic Centre Party\n                            would support the Enabling Act in the Reichstag, thereby providing the ⅔ majority required\n                            to ratify a law that amended the constitution. Hitler expressed his confidence to win over\n                            the centre's votes. Hitler is recorded at the Nuremberg Trials as being sure of eventual\n                            Centre Party Germany capitulation and thus rejecting of the DNVP's suggestions to \"balance\"\n                            the majority through further arrests, this time of Social Democrats. Hitler, however,\n                            assured his coalition partners that arrests would resume after the elections and, in fact,\n                            some 26 SPD Social Democrats were physically removed. After meeting with Centre leader\n                            Monsignor Ludwig Kaas and other Centre Trade Union leaders daily and denying them a\n                            substantial participation in the government, negotiation succeeded in respect of guarantees\n                            towards Catholic civil-servants and education issues.</p>\n                        <p>At the last internal Centre meeting prior to the debate on the Enabling Act, Kaas expressed\n                            no preference or suggestion on the vote, but as a way of mollifying opposition by Centre\n                            members to the granting of further powers to Hitler, Kaas somehow arranged for a letter of\n                            constitutional guarantee from Hitler himself prior to his voting with the centre en bloc in\n                            favour of the Enabling Act. This guarantee was not ultimately given. Kaas, the party's\n                            chairman since 1928, had strong connections to the Vatican Secretary of State, later Pope\n                            Pius XII. In return for pledging his support for the act, Kaas would use his connections\n                            with the Vatican to set in train and draft the Holy See's long desired Reichskonkordat with\n                            Germany (only possible with the co-operation of the Nazis).</p>\n                        <p>Ludwig Kaas is considered along with Papen as being one of the two most important political\n                            figures in the creation of the Nazi regime.</p>\n                        <h5>Enabling Act negotiations</h5>\n                        <p>On 20 March, negotiation began between Hitler and Frick on one side and the Catholic Centre\n                            Party (Zentrum) leaders—Kaas, Stegerwald and Hackelsburger on the other. The aim was to\n                            settle on conditions under which Centre would vote in favour of the Enabling Act. Because of\n                            the Nazis' narrow majority in the Reichstag, Centre's support was necessary to receive the\n                            required two-thirds majority vote. On 22 March, the negotiations concluded; Hitler promised\n                            to continue the existence of the German states, agreed not to use the new grant of power to\n                            change the constitution, and promised to retain Zentrum members in the civil service. Hitler\n                            also pledged to protect the Catholic confessional schools and to respect the concordats\n                            signed between the Holy See and Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929) and Baden (1931). Hitler also\n                            agreed to mention these promises in his speech to the Reichstag before the vote on the\n                            Enabling Act.</p>\n                        <p>The ceremonial opening of the Reichstag on 21 March was held at the Garrison Church in\n                            Potsdam, a shrine of Prussianism, in the presence of many Junker landowners and\n                            representatives of the imperial military caste. This impressive and often emotional\n                            spectacle—orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels—aimed to link Hitler's government with Germany's\n                            imperial past and portray Nazism as a guarantor of the nation's future. The ceremony helped\n                            convince the \"old guard\" Prussian military elite of Hitler's homage to their long tradition\n                            and, in turn, produced the relatively convincing view that Hitler's government had the\n                            support of Germany's traditional protector—the Army. Such support would publicly signal a\n                            return to conservatism to curb the problems affecting the Weimar Republic, and that\n                            stability might be at hand. In a cynical and politically adroit move, Hitler bowed in\n                            apparently respectful humility before President and Field Marshal Hindenburg.</p>\n                        <h5>Passage of the Enabling Act</h5>\n                        <p>The Reichstag convened on 23 March 1933, and in the midday opening, Hitler made a historic\n                            speech, appearing outwardly calm and conciliatory. Hitler presented an appealing prospect of\n                            respect towards Christianity by paying tribute to the Christian faiths as \"essential\n                            elements for safeguarding the soul of the German people\". He promised to respect their\n                            rights and declared that his government's \"ambition is a peaceful accord between Church and\n                            State\" and that he hoped \"to improve [their] friendly relations with the Holy See\". This\n                            speech aimed especially at the future recognition by the named Holy See and therefore to the\n                            votes of the Centre Party addressing many concerns Kaas had voiced during the previous\n                            talks. Kaas is considered to have had a hand therefore in the drafting of the speech.[65]\n                            Kaas is also reported as voicing the Holy See's desire for Hitler as bulwark against\n                            atheistic Russian nihilism previously as early as May 1932.</p>\n                        <p>Hitler promised that the Act did not threaten the existence of either the Reichstag or the\n                            Reichsrat, that the authority of the President remained untouched and that the Länder would\n                            not be abolished. During an adjournment, the other parties (notably the centre) met to\n                            discuss their intentions.</p>\n                        <p>In the debate prior to the vote on the Enabling Act, Hitler orchestrated the full political\n                            menace of his paramilitary forces like the storm division in the streets to intimidate\n                            reluctant Reichstag deputies into approving the Enabling Act. The Communists' 81 seats had\n                            been empty since the Reichstag Fire Decree and other lesser known procedural measures, thus\n                            excluding their anticipated \"No\" votes from the balloting. Otto Wels, the leader of the\n                            Social Democrats, whose seats were similarly depleted from 120 to below 100, was the only\n                            speaker to defend democracy and in a futile but brave effort to deny Hitler the ⅔ majority,\n                            he made a speech critical of the abandonment of democracy to dictatorship. At this, Hitler\n                            could no longer restrain his wrath.</p>\n                        <p>In his retort to Wels, Hitler abandoned earlier pretence at calm statesmanship and delivered\n                            a characteristic screaming diatribe, promising to exterminate all Communists in Germany and\n                            threatening Wels' Social Democrats as well. He did not even want their support for the bill.\n                            \"Germany will become free, but not through you,\" he shouted.[69] Meanwhile, Hitler's\n                            promised written guarantee to Monsignor Kaas was being typed up, it was asserted to Kaas,\n                            and thereby Kaas was persuaded to silently deliver the Centre bloc's votes for the Enabling\n                            Act anyway. The Act—formally titled the \"Act for the Removal of Distress from People and\n                            Reich\"—was passed by a vote of 441 to 94. Only the SPD had voted against the Act. Every\n                            other member of the Reichstag, whether from the largest or the smallest party, voted in\n                            favour of the Act. It went into effect the following day, 24 March.</p>\n                        <h5>Consequences</h5>\n                        <p>The passage of the Enabling Act of 1933 is widely considered to mark the end of the Weimar\n                            Republic and the beginning of the Nazi era. It empowered the cabinet to legislate without\n                            the approval of the Reichstag or the President, and to enact laws that were contrary to the\n                            constitution. Before the March 1933 elections, Hitler had persuaded Hindenburg to promulgate\n                            the Reichstag Fire Decree using Article 48, which empowered the government to restrict \"the\n                            rights of habeas corpus [...] freedom of the press, the freedom to organise and assemble,\n                            the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications\" and legalised search\n                            warrants and confiscation \"beyond legal limits otherwise prescribed\". This was intended to\n                            forestall any action against the government by the Communists. Hitler used the provisions of\n                            the Enabling Act to pre-empt possible opposition to his dictatorship from other sources, in\n                            which he was mostly successful.</p>\n                        <p>The Nazis in power brought almost all major organisations into line under Nazi control or\n                            direction, which was termed Gleichschaltung.</p>\n                        <p>The constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that it was\n                            a dead letter. Those articles of the Weimar constitution (which dealt with the state's\n                            relationship to various Christian churches) remain part of the German Basic Law.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art07\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Reasons for failure</h4>\n                        <p>The reasons for the Weimar Republic's collapse are the subject of continuing debate. It may\n                            have been doomed from the beginning since even moderates disliked it and extremists on both\n                            the left and right loathed it, a situation often referred to as a \"democracy without\n                            democrats\".[70] Germany had limited democratic traditions, and Weimar democracy was widely\n                            seen as chaotic. Since Weimar politicians had been blamed for the Dolchstoß\n                            (\"stab-in-the-back\"), a widely believed theory that Germany's surrender in the First World\n                            War had been the unnecessary act of traitors, the popular legitimacy of the government was\n                            on shaky ground. As normal parliamentary lawmaking broke down and was replaced around 1930\n                            by a series of emergency decrees, the decreasing popular legitimacy of the government\n                            further drove voters to extremist parties.</p>\n                        <p>No single reason can explain the failure of the Weimar Republic. The most commonly asserted\n                            causes can be grouped into three categories: economic problems, institutional problems, and\n                            the roles of specific individuals.</p>\n                        <h5>Economic problems</h5>\n                        <p>The Weimar Republic had some of the most serious economic problems ever experienced by any\n                            Western democracy in history. Rampant hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and a large drop\n                            in living standards were primary factors. From 1923 to 1929, there was a short period of\n                            economic recovery, but the Great Depression of the 1930s led to a worldwide recession.\n                            Germany was particularly affected because it depended heavily on American loans. In 1926,\n                            about 2 million Germans were unemployed, which rose to around 6 million in 1932. Many blamed\n                            the Weimar Republic. That was made apparent when political parties on both right and left\n                            wanting to disband the Republic altogether made any democratic majority in Parliament\n                            impossible.</p>\n                        <p>The Weimar Republic was severely affected by the Great Depression. The economic stagnation\n                            led to increased demands on Germany to repay the debts owed to the United States. As the\n                            Weimar Republic was very fragile in all its existence, the depression was devastating, and\n                            played a major role in the Nazi takeover.</p>\n                        <p>Most Germans thought the Treaty of Versailles was a punishing and degrading document because\n                            it forced them to surrender resource-rich areas and pay massive amounts of compensation. The\n                            punitive reparations caused consternation and resentment, but the actual economic damage\n                            resulting from the Treaty of Versailles is difficult to determine. While the official\n                            reparations were considerable, Germany ended up paying only a fraction of them. However, the\n                            reparations damaged Germany's economy by discouraging market loans, which forced the Weimar\n                            government to finance its deficit by printing more currency, causing rampant hyperinflation.\n                            At the beginning of 1920, 50 marks was equivalent to one US dollar. By the end of 1923, one\n                            US dollar was equal to 4,200,000,000,000 marks.[71] In addition, the rapid disintegration of\n                            Germany in 1919 by the return of a disillusioned army, the rapid change from possible\n                            victory in 1918 to defeat in 1919, and the political chaos may have led to extreme\n                            nationalism.</p>\n                        <p>Princeton historian Harold James argues that there was a clear link between economic decline\n                            and people turning to extremist politics.</p>\n                        <h5>Institutional problems</h5>\n                        <p>It is widely believed that the 1919 constitution had several weaknesses, making the eventual\n                            establishment of a dictatorship likely, but it is unknown whether a different constitution\n                            could have prevented the rise of the Nazi party. However, the 1949 West German constitution\n                            (the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany) is generally viewed as a strong response\n                            to these flaws.</p>\n                        <h5>Role of individuals</h5>\n                        <p>Brüning's economic policy from 1930 to 1932 has been the subject of much debate. It caused\n                            many Germans to identify the Republic with cuts in social spending and extremely liberal\n                            economics. Whether there were alternatives to this policy during the Great Depression is an\n                            open question.</p>\n                        <p>Paul von Hindenburg became Reichspräsident in 1925. As he was an old style monarchist\n                            conservative, he had little love lost for the Republic,[citation needed] but for the most\n                            part, he formally acted within the bounds of the constitution;[citation needed] however, he\n                            ultimately—on the advice of his son and others close to him—appointed Hitler chancellor,\n                            thereby effectively ending the Republic. Additionally, Hindenburg's death in 1934 ended the\n                            last obstacle for Hitler to assume full power in the Weimar Republic.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">Weimar Republic</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Weimarer Republik</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">1918–1933</h2>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_year\">Germany: 1918–1933</h3>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_weimr.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of Weimar Republic</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>Berlin</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">Weimar Republic</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">Name and symbols</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec03\">Armed forces</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec04\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td>468,787 km<sup>2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td>UTC+1</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_weimr.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map of German Empire</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td>62,411,000 (1925)</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Protestant (64%)</li>\n                                <li>Roman Catholic (32%)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Languages</th>\n                        <td>German</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Papiermark (1919–1923)</li>\n                                <li>Rentenmark (1923–1933)</li>\n                                <li>Reichsmark (1924–1933)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Federal semi-presidential republic (1919–1930)</li>\n                                <li>Federal authoritarian presidential republic (1930–1933)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>President, Chancellor</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Friedrich Ebert (President, 1919-1925)</li>\n                                <li>Paul von Hindenburg (President, 1925-1933)</li>\n                                <li>Philipp Scheidermann (Chancellor, 1919)</li>\n                                <li>Adolf Hitler (Chancellor, 1933)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n            </div>\n        "},{"html":"\n            <div id=\"main_content\">\n                <h1 id=\"data_title\">Nazi Germany</h1>\n                <h2 id=\"data_year\">1933-1945</h2>\n                <hr>\n                <section id=\"sec01\">\n                    <p>Nazi Germany,[f] officially known as the German Reich[g] until 1943 and Greater German Reich[h] from 1943 to 1945, was the German state between 1933 and 1945, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party controlled the country which they transformed into a dictatorship. Under Hitler's rule, Germany quickly became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich,[i] meaning \"Third Realm\" or \"Third Empire\", alluded to the Nazis' conceit that Nazi Germany was the successor to the earlier Holy Roman Empire (800–1806) and German Empire (1871–1918). The Third Reich, which Hitler and the Nazis referred to as the Thousand Year Reich,[4][j] ended in May 1945 after just 12 years, when the Allies defeated Germany, ending World War II in Europe.</p>\n                    <p>On 30 January 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, the head of government, by the President of the Weimar Republic, Paul von Hindenburg, the head of State. The Nazi Party then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (Leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Using deficit spending, the regime undertook a massive secret rearmament program and the construction of extensive public works projects, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.</p>\n                    <p>Racism, Nazi eugenics, and especially antisemitism, were central ideological features of the regime. The Germanic peoples were considered by the Nazis to be the master race, the purest branch of the Aryan race. Discrimination and the persecution of Jews and Romani people began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first concentration camps were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that opposed Hitler's rule were oppressed and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program, and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased Germany on the international stage. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.</p>\n                    <p>From the latter half of the 1930s, Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. The Saarland voted by plebiscite to rejoin Germany in 1935, and in 1936 Hitler sent troops into the Rhineland, which had been de-militarized after World War I. Germany seized Austria in the Anschluss of 1938, and demanded and received the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia in that same year. In March 1939, the Slovak state was proclaimed and became a client state of Germany, and the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was established on the remainder of the occupied Czech Lands. Shortly after, Germany pressured Lithuania into ceding the Memel Territory. Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union and invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. By early 1941, Germany and their European allies in the Axis powers controlled much of Europe. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies.</p>\n                    <p>Genocide and mass murder became hallmarks of the regime. Starting in 1939, hundreds of thousands of German citizens with mental or physical disabilities were murdered in hospitals and asylums. Einsatzgruppen paramilitary death squads accompanied the German armed forces inside the occupied territories and conducted the mass killings of millions of Jews and other Holocaust victims. After 1941, millions of others were imprisoned, worked to death, or murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps. This genocide is known as the Holocaust.</p>\n                    <p>While the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the United States into the war meant that the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the Allied invasion of France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the other Allies from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Geography</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Territorial changes</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Occupied territories</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Territorial changes</h4>\n                        <p>As a result of their defeat in World War I and the resulting Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine, Northern Schleswig, and Memel.

Several areas, such as Alsace-Lorraine, were placed under the authority of an adjacent Gau (regional district). The Reichskommissariate (Reich Commissariats), quasi-colonial regimes, were established in some occupied countries. Areas placed under German administration included the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Reichskommissariat Ostland (encompassing the Baltic states and Belarus), and Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Conquered areas of Belgium and France were placed under control of the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France.[170] Belgian Eupen-Malmedy, which had been part of Germany until 1919, was annexed. Part of Poland was incorporated into the Reich, and the General Government was established in occupied central Poland.[171] The governments of Denmark, Norway (Reichskommissariat Norwegen), and the Netherlands (Reichskommissariat Niederlande) were placed under civilian administrations staffed largely by natives.[170][l] Hitler intended to eventually incorporate many of these areas into the Reich.[172] Germany occupied the Italian protectorate of Albania and the Italian governorate of Montenegro in 1943[173] and installed a puppet government in occupied Serbia in 1941.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>Politics</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn03\" disabled=\"\">Ideology</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Government</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn05\">Law</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\">\n                        <h4>Ideology</h4>\n                        <p>The Nazis were a far-right fascist political party which arose during the social and financial upheavals that occurred following the end of World War I.[175] The Party remained small and marginalised, receiving 2.6% of the federal vote in 1928, prior to the onset of the Great Depression in 1929.[176] By 1930 the Party won 18.3% of the federal vote, making it the Reichstag's second largest political party.[177] While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race.[178] Nazi ideology brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people.[179] The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race and part of a Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.[180][181] The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry.[182] Other people deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the mentally and physically disabled, Romani people, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and social misfits.</p>\n                        <p>Influenced by the Völkisch movement, the regime was against cultural modernism and supported the development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism.[12][185] Creativity and art were stifled, except where they could serve as propaganda media.[186] The party used symbols such as the Blood Flag and rituals such as the Nazi Party rallies to foster unity and bolster the regime's popularity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Goverment</h4>\n                        <p>Hitler ruled Germany autocratically by asserting the Führerprinzip (\"leader principle\"), which called for absolute obedience by all subordinates. He viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Party rank was not determined by elections, and positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank.[188] The party used propaganda to develop a cult of personality around Hitler.[189] Historians such as Kershaw emphasise the psychological impact of Hitler's skill as an orator.[190] Roger Gill states: \"His moving speeches captured the minds and hearts of a vast number of the German people: he virtually hypnotized his audiences\".</p>\n                        <p>While top officials reported to Hitler and followed his policies, they had considerable autonomy.[192] He expected officials to \"work towards the Führer\" – to take the initiative in promoting policies and actions in line with party goals and Hitler's wishes, without his involvement in day-to-day decision-making.[193] The government was a disorganised collection of factions led by the party elite, who struggled to amass power and gain the Führer's favour.[194] Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them in positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.[195] In this way he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.</p>\n                        <p>Successive Reichsstatthalter decrees between 1933 and 1935 abolished the existing Länder (constituent states) of Germany and replaced them with new administrative divisions, the Gaue, governed by Nazi leaders (Gauleiters).[197] The change was never fully implemented, as the Länder were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments such as education. This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime.</p>\n                        <p>Jewish civil servants lost their jobs in 1933, except for those who had seen military service in World War I. Members of the Party or party supporters were appointed in their place.[199] As part of the process of Gleichschaltung, the Reich Local Government Law of 1935 abolished local elections, and mayors were appointed by the Ministry of the Interior.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Law</h4>\n                        <p>In August 1934, civil servants and members of the military were required to swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler. These laws became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws.[201] Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal.[202] All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who could also veto top civil service appointments.</p>\n                        <p>Most of the judicial system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in place to deal with non-political crimes.[204] The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power.[204] People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely.[205] People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.</p>\n                        <p>A new type of court, the Volksgerichtshof (\"People's Court\"), was established in 1934 to deal with political cases.[207] This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945.[208] The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets, or even making jokes about Hitler or other officials.[209] The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce Nazi ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews, and others deemed undesirable.[210] Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.</p>\n                        <p>The Nazis used propaganda to promulgate the concept of Rassenschande (\"race defilement\") to justify the need for racial laws.[212] In September 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. These laws initially prohibited sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include \"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\".[213] The law also forbade the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households.[214] The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of \"German or related blood\" could be citizens.[215] Thus Jews and other non-Aryans were stripped of their German citizenship. The law also permitted the Nazis to deny citizenship to anyone who was not supportive enough of the regime.[215] A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents, or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec04\">\n                    <h3>Military and paramilitary</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn06\" disabled=\"\">Wehrmacht</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn07\">The SA and SS</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\">\n                        <h4>Wehrmacht</h4>\n                        <p>The unified armed forces of Germany from 1935 to 1945 were called the Wehrmacht (defence force). This included the Heer (army), Kriegsmarine (navy), and the Luftwaffe (air force). From 2 August 1934, members of the armed forces were required to pledge an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler personally. In contrast to the previous oath, which required allegiance to the constitution of the country and its lawful establishments, this new oath required members of the military to obey Hitler even if they were being ordered to do something illegal.[217] Hitler decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the Einsatzgruppen—the mobile death squads responsible for millions of deaths in Eastern Europe—when it was tactically possible to do so.[218] Wehrmacht troops also participated directly in the Holocaust by shooting civilians or committing genocide under the guise of anti-partisan operations.[219] The party line was that the Jews were the instigators of the partisan struggle and therefore needed to be eliminated.[220] On 8 July 1941, Heydrich announced that all Jews in the eastern conquered territories were to be regarded as partisans and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot.[221] By August, this was extended to include the entire Jewish population.</p>\n                        <p>In spite of efforts to prepare the country militarily, the economy could not sustain a lengthy war of attrition. A strategy was developed based on the tactic of Blitzkrieg (\"lightning war\"), which involved using quick coordinated assaults that avoided enemy strong points. Attacks began with artillery bombardment, followed by bombing and strafing runs. Next the tanks would attack and finally the infantry would move in to secure the captured area.[223] Victories continued through mid-1940, but the failure to defeat Britain was the first major turning point in the war. The decision to attack the Soviet Union and the decisive defeat at Stalingrad led to the retreat of the German armies and the eventual loss of the war.[224] The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht from 1935 to 1945 was around 18.2 million, of whom 5.3 million died.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art07\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>The SA and SS</h4>\n                        <p>The Sturmabteilung (SA; Storm Detachment), or Brownshirts, founded in 1921, was the first paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party; their initial assignment was to protect Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies.[225] They also took part in street battles against the forces of rival political parties and violent actions against Jews and others.[226] Under Ernst Röhm's leadership the SA grew by 1934 to over half a million members—4.5 million including reserves—at a time when the regular army was still limited to 100,000 men by the Versailles Treaty.</p>\n                        <p>Röhm hoped to assume command of the army and absorb it into the ranks of the SA.[228] Hindenburg and Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg threatened to impose martial law if the activities of the SA were not curtailed.[229] Therefore, less than a year and a half after seizing power, Hitler ordered the deaths of the SA leadership, including Rohm. After the purge of 1934, the SA was no longer a major force.</p>\n                        <p>Initially a small bodyguard unit under the auspices of the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS; Protection Squadron) grew to become one of the largest and most powerful groups in Nazi Germany.[230] Led by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler from 1929, the SS had over a quarter million members by 1938.[231] Himmler initially envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's last line of defence.[232] The Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS, evolved into a second army. It was dependent on the regular army for heavy weaponry and equipment, and most units were under tactical control of the High Command of the Armed Forces (OKW).[233][234] By the end of 1942, the stringent selection and racial requirements that had initially been in place were no longer followed. With recruitment and conscription based only on expansion, by 1943 the Waffen-SS could not longer claim to be an elite fighting force.</p>\n                        <p>SS formations committed many war crimes against civilians and allied servicemen.[236] From 1935 onward, the SS spearheaded the persecution of Jews, who were rounded up into ghettos and concentration camps.[237] With the outbreak of World War II, the SS Einsatzgruppen units followed the army into Poland and the Soviet Union, where from 1941 to 1945 they killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.[238] A third of the Einsatzgruppen members were recruited from Waffen-SS personnel.[239][240] The SS-Totenkopfverbände (death's head units) ran the concentration camps and extermination camps, where millions more were killed.[241][242] Up to 60,000 Waffen-SS men served in the camps.</p>\n                   <p>In 1931, Himmler organised an SS intelligence service which became known as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) under his deputy, Heydrich.[244] This organisation was tasked with locating and arresting communists and other political opponents.[245][246] Himmler established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office. This holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec05\">\n                    <h3>Economy</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn08\" disabled=\"\">Reich economics</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn09\">Wartime economy and forced labour</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn10\">Financial exploitation of conquered territories</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art08\">\n                        <h4>Reich economics</h4>\n                        <p>The most pressing economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate.[249] Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created a scheme for deficit financing in May 1933. Capital projects were paid for with the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money. Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the soaring national debt.[250] Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.[249] Economic recovery was uneven, with reduced hours of work and erratic availability of necessities, leading to disenchantment with the regime as early as 1934.</p>\n                        <p>In October 1933, the Junkers Aircraft Works was expropriated. In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and under the direction of Aviation Minister Göring, production was ramped up. From a workforce of 3,200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932, the industry grew to employ a quarter of a million workers manufacturing over 10,000 technically advanced aircraft annually less than ten years later.</p>\n                        <p>An elaborate bureaucracy was created to regulate imports of raw materials and finished goods with the intention of eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles.[253] As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as excess profits were by then being generated.[254] In another attempt to secure an adequate wartime supply of petroleum, Germany intimidated Romania into signing a trade agreement in March 1939.</p>\n                        <p>Major public works projects financed with deficit spending included the construction of a network of Autobahnen and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements.[256] To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs.[257] On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry, and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born.[258] The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed outside the home was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.</p>\n                        <p>Envisioning widespread car ownership as part of the new Germany, Hitler arranged for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that everyone could afford. A prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. None were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).</p>\n                        <p>Six million people were unemployed when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there were fewer than a million.[261] This was in part due to the removal of women from the workforce.[262] Real wages dropped by 25 percent between 1933 and 1938.[249] After the dissolution of the trade unions in May 1933, their funds were seized and their leadership arrested,[263] including those who attempted to co-operate with the Nazis.[34] A new organisation, the German Labour Front, was created and placed under Nazi Party functionary Robert Ley.[263] The average work week was 43 hours in 1933; by 1939 this increased to 47 hours.</p>\n                        <p>By early 1934, the focus shifted towards rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services.[265] On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended to speed up rearmament.[266] In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants, and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends.[249] Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits.[267] Plans unveiled in late 1938 for massive increases to the navy and air force were impossible to fulfil, as Germany lacked the finances and material resources to build the planned units, as well as the necessary fuel required to keep them running.[268] With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve.[269] By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art09\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Wartime economy and forced labour</h4>\n                        <p>The Nazi war economy was a mixed economy that combined a free market with central planning. Historian Richard Overy describes it as being somewhere in between the command economy of the Soviet Union and the capitalist system of the United States.</p>\n                        <p>In 1942, after the death of Armaments Minister Fritz Todt, Hitler appointed Albert Speer as his replacement.[272] Wartime rationing of consumer goods led to an increase in personal savings, funds which were in turn lent to the government to support the war effort.[273] By 1944, the war was consuming 75 percent of Germany's gross domestic product, compared to 60 percent in the Soviet Union and 55 percent in Britain.[274] Speer improved production by centralising planning and control, reducing production of consumer goods, and using forced labour and slavery.[275][276] The wartime economy eventually relied heavily upon the large-scale employment of slave labour. Germany imported and enslaved some 12 million people from 20 European countries to work in factories and on farms. Approximately 75 percent were Eastern European.[277] Many were casualties of Allied bombing, as they received poor air raid protection. Poor living conditions led to high rates of sickness, injury, and death, as well as sabotage and criminal activity.[278] The wartime economy also relied upon large-scale robbery, initially through the state seizing the property of Jewish citizens and later by plundering the resources of occupied territories.</p>\n                        <p>Foreign workers brought into Germany were put into four classifications: guest workers, military internees, civilian workers, and Eastern workers. Each group was subject to different regulations. The Nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign workers.</p>\n                        <p>By 1944, over a half million women served as auxiliaries in the German armed forces.[282] The number of women in paid employment only increased by 271,000 (1.8 percent) from 1939 to 1944.[283] As the production of consumer goods had been cut back, women left those industries for employment in the war economy. They also took jobs formerly held by men, especially on farms and in family-owned shops.</p>\n                        <p>Very heavy strategic bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing synthetic oil and gasoline, as well as the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals.[285] The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible.[286] Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one-fourth of its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art10\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Financial exploitation of conquered territories</h4>\n                        <p>During the course of the war, the Nazis extracted considerable plunder from occupied Europe. Historian and war correspondent William L. Shirer writes: \"The total amount of [Nazi] loot will never be known; it has proved beyond man's capacity to accurately compute.\"[288] Gold reserves and other foreign holdings were seized from the national banks of occupied nations, while large \"occupation costs\" were usually imposed. By the end of the war, occupation costs were calculated by the Nazis at 60 billion Reichsmarks, with France alone paying 31.5 billion. The Bank of France was forced to provide 4.5 billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey concluded Germany had obtained 104 billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the gross domestic product of Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>\n                        <p>Nazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions. Hitler and Göring in particular were interested in acquiring looted art treasures from occupied Europe,[289] the former planning to use the stolen art to fill the galleries of the planned Führermuseum (Leader's Museum),[290] and the latter for his personal collection. Göring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50 million Reichsmarks.[289] In 1940, the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.[291] By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.[292] In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing—items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany—for shipment home.</p>\n                        <p>Goods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated 9,000,000 tonnes (8,900,000 long tons; 9,900,000 short tons) of cereals were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5 billion francs. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.</p>\n                        <p>Following Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, 2,000,000 tonnes (2,000,000 long tons; 2,200,000 short tons) of fodder, 3,000,000 tonnes (3,000,000 long tons; 3,300,000 short tons) of potatoes, and 662,000 tonnes (652,000 long tons; 730,000 short tons) of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12 million pigs and 13 million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4 billion Reichsmarks. This relatively low number in comparison to the occupied nations of Western Europe can be attributed to the devastating fighting on the Eastern Front.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec06\">\n                    <h3>Racial policy and eugenics</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn11\" disabled=\"\">Racism and antisemitism</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn12\">Persecution of Jews</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn13\">Persecution of Roma</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn14\">Other persecuted groups</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn15\">Generalplan Ost</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn16\">The Holocaust and Final Solution</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn17\">Oppression of ethnic Poles</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn18\">Mistreatment of Soviet POWs</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art11\">\n                        <h4>Racism and antisemitism</h4>\n                        <p>Racism and antisemitism were basic tenets of the Nazi Party and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief in the existence of a superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art12\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Persecution of Jews</h4>\n                        <p>Discrimination against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power. Following a month-long series of attacks by members of the SA on Jewish businesses and synagogues, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses.[297] The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service passed on 7 April forced all non-Aryan civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service.[298] Similar legislation soon deprived other Jewish professionals of their right to practise, and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish parent or grandparent was considered non-Aryan.[299] As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist German Students' League removed from libraries any books considered un-German, and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May.</p>\n                        <p>The regime used violence and economic pressure to encourage Jews to leave the country voluntarily.[301] Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks.[302] Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews.</p>\n                        <p>On 7 November 1938 a young Jewish man, Herschel Grynszpan, shot and killed Ernst vom Rath, a legation secretary at the German embassy in Paris, to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the Nazis incited against the Jews two days later. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were killed during this pogrom, later called Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass.[304][305] Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months – they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library, or own weapons, and Jewish pupils were removed from schools. The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by Kristallnacht and told that any insurance settlements would be confiscated.[306] By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine, and other countries.[307][308] Many chose to stay in continental Europe. Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there under the terms of the Haavara Agreement, but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind, and it was seized by the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art13\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Persecution of Roma</h4>\n                        <p>Like the Jews, the Romani people were subjected to persecution from the early days of the regime. The Romani were forbidden to marry people of German extraction. They were shipped to concentration camps starting in 1935 and many were killed.[183][184] Following the invasion of Poland, 2,500 Roma and Sinti people were deported from Germany to the General Government, where they were imprisoned in labour camps. The survivors were likely exterminated at Bełżec, Sobibor, or Treblinka. A further 5,000 Sinti and Austrian Lalleri people were deported to the Łódź Ghetto in late 1941, where half were estimated to have died. The Romani survivors of the ghetto were subsequently moved to the Chełmno extermination camp in early 1942.</p>\n                        <p>The Nazis intended on deporting all Romani people from Germany, and confined them to Zigeunerlager (Gypsy camps) for this purpose. Himmler ordered their deportation from Germany in December 1942, with few exceptions. A total of 23,000 Romani were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, of whom 19,000 died. Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were killed. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were killed by the SS, the German Army, and Einsatzgruppen. In occupied Serbia, 1,000 to 12,000 Romani were killed, while nearly all 25,000 Romani living in the Independent State of Croatia were killed. The estimates at end of the war put the total death toll at around 220,000, which equalled approximately 25 percent of the Romani population in Europe.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art14\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Other persecuted groups</h4>\n                        <p>Action T4 was a programme of systematic murder of the physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that took place mainly from 1939 to 1941, and continued until the end of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940.[310][311] Under the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring, enacted on 14 July 1933, over 400,000 individuals underwent compulsory sterilisation.[312] Over half were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour, and cleanliness. Most of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless, and criminals.[313] Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits, and members of the political and religious opposition.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art15\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Generalplan Ost</h4>\n                        <p>Germany's war in the East was based on Hitler's long-standing view that Jews were the great enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion. Hitler focused his attention on Eastern Europe, aiming to conquer Poland and the Soviet Union.[180][181] After the occupation of Poland in 1939, all Jews living in the General Government were confined to ghettos, and those who were physically fit were required to perform compulsory labour.[315] In 1941 Hitler decided to destroy the Polish nation completely; within 15 to 20 years the General Government was to be cleared of ethnic Poles and resettled by German colonists.[316] About 3.8 to 4 million Poles would remain as slaves,[317] part of a slave labour force of 14 million the Nazis intended to create using citizens of conquered nations.</p>\n                        <p>The Generalplan Ost (\"General Plan for the East\") called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered.[319] To determine who should be killed, Himmler created the Volksliste, a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood.[320] He ordered that those of Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour.[321][322] The plan also included the kidnapping of children deemed to have Aryan-Nordic traits, who were presumed to be of German descent.[323] The goal was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the invasion failed Hitler had to consider other options.[319][324] One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland, Palestine, or Madagascar.</p>\n                        <p>In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.[325] Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union.[326] These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) throughout the USSR and elsewhere in Europe.[327] During the course of the war, the Soviet Union lost a total of 27 million people; less than nine million of these were combat deaths.[328] One in four of the Soviet population were killed or wounded.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art16\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>The Holocaust and Final Solution</h4>\n                        <p>Around the time of the failed offensive against Moscow in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately.[330] While the murder of Jewish civilians had been ongoing in the occupied territories of Poland and the Soviet Union, plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the Final Solution to the Jewish Question.[331] Initially the victims were killed by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, then by stationary gas chambers or by gas vans, but these methods proved impractical for an operation of this scale.[332][333] By 1942 extermination camps equipped with gas chambers were established at Auschwitz, Chełmno, Sobibor, Treblinka, and elsewhere.[334] The total number of Jews murdered is estimated at 5.5 to six million,[242] including over a million children.</p>\n                        <p>The Allies received information about the murders from the Polish government-in-exile and Polish leadership in Warsaw, based mostly on intelligence from the Polish underground.[336][337] German citizens had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from the occupied territories reported on what they had seen and done.[338] Historian Richard J. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art17\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Oppression of ethnic Poles</h4>\n                        <p>Poles were viewed by Nazis as subhuman non-Aryans, and during the German occupation of Poland 2.7 million ethnic Poles were killed.[340] Polish civilians were subject to forced labour in German industry, internment, wholesale expulsions to make way for German colonists, and mass executions. The German authorities engaged in a systematic effort to destroy Polish culture and national identity. During operation AB-Aktion, many university professors and members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested, transported to concentration camps, or executed. During the war, Poland lost an estimated 39 to 45 percent of its physicians and dentists, 26 to 57 percent of its lawyers, 15 to 30 percent of its teachers, 30 to 40 percent of its scientists and university professors, and 18 to 28 percent of its clergy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art18\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Mistreatment of Soviet POWs</h4>\n                        <p>The Nazis captured 5.75 million Soviet prisoners of war, more than they took from all the other Allied powers combined. Of these, they killed an estimated 3.3 million,[342] with 2.8 million of them being killed between June 1941 and January 1942.[343] Many POWs starved to death or resorted to cannibalism while being held in open-air pens at Auschwitz and elsewhere.</p>\n                        <p>From 1942 onward, Soviet POWs were viewed as a source of forced labour, and received better treatment so they could work.[345] By December 1944, 750,000 Soviet POWs were working, including in German armaments factories (in violation of the Hague and Geneva conventions), mines, and farms.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec07\">\n                    <h3>Society</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn19\" disabled=\"\">Education</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn20\">Role of women and family</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn21\">Health</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn22\">Environmentalism</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn23\">Oppression of churches</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn24\">Resistance to the regime</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art19\">\n                        <h4>Education</h4>\n                        <p>Antisemitic legislation passed in 1933 led to the removal of all Jewish teachers, professors, and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required to belong to the Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (NSLB; National Socialist Teachers League) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers.[347][348] Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler, and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed.[349][350] Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession. The average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.</p>\n                        <p>Frequent and often contradictory directives were issued by Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, Bernhard Rust of the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, and other agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools.[352] Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries.[353] Indoctrination in Nazi ideology was made compulsory in January 1934.[353] Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated from the age of 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education for secondary education. Detailed indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles.</p>\n                        <p>Primary and secondary education focused on racial biology, population policy, culture, geography, and physical fitness.[355] The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography, and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race.[356] Military education became the central component of physical education, and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications, such as ballistics and aerodynamics.[357][358] Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.</p>\n                        <p>At universities, appointments to top posts were the subject of power struggles between the education ministry, the university boards, and the National Socialist German Students' League.[359] In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries, most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period.[360] This was especially true of universities located in predominantly Catholic regions.[361] Enrolment at German universities declined from 104,000 students in 1931 to 41,000 in 1939, but enrolment in medical schools rose sharply as Jewish doctors had been forced to leave the profession, so medical graduates had good job prospects.[362] From 1934, university students were required to attend frequent and time-consuming military training sessions run by the SA.[363] First-year students also had to serve six months in a labour camp for the Reich Labour Service; an additional ten weeks service were required of second-year students.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art20\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Role of women and family</h4>\n                        <p>Women were a cornerstone of Nazi social policy. The Nazis opposed the feminist movement, claiming that it was the creation of Jewish intellectuals, instead advocating a patriarchal society in which the German woman would recognise that her \"world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home\".[262] Feminist groups were shut down or incorporated into the National Socialist Women's League, which coordinated groups throughout the country to promote motherhood and household activities. Courses were offered on childrearing, sewing, and cooking. Prominent feminists, including Anita Augspurg, Lida Gustava Heymann, and Helene Stöcker, felt forced to live in exile.[365] The League published the NS-Frauen-Warte, the only Nazi-approved women's magazine in Nazi Germany;[366] despite some propaganda aspects, it was predominantly an ordinary woman's magazine.</p>\n                        <p>Women were encouraged to leave the workforce, and the creation of large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six, and gold for eight or more.[365] Large families received subsidies to help with expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940.[368] Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men, as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers, or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men.[369] Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used.[370] In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort.[371] Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs, and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.</p>\n                        <p>Nazi leaders endorsed the idea that rational and theoretical work was alien to a woman's nature, and as such discouraged women from seeking higher education. [373] A law passed in April 1933 limited the number of females admitted to university to ten percent of the number of male attendees.[374] This resulted in female enrolment in secondary schools dropping from 437,000 in 1926 to 205,000 in 1937. The number of women enrolled in post-secondary schools dropped from 128,000 in 1933 to 51,000 in 1938. However, with the requirement that men be enlisted into the armed forces during the war, women comprised half of the enrolment in the post-secondary system by 1944.</p>\n                        <p>Women were expected to be strong, healthy, and vital.[376] The sturdy peasant woman who worked the land and bore strong children was considered ideal, and women were praised for being athletic and tanned from working outdoors.[377] Organisations were created for the indoctrination of Nazi values. From 25 March 1939 membership in the Hitler Youth was made compulsory for all children over the age of ten.[378] The Jungmädelbund (Young Girls League) section of the Hitler Youth was for girls age 10 to 14 and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM; League of German Girls) was for young women age 14 to 18. The BDM's activities focused on physical education, with activities such as running, long jumping, somersaulting, tightrope walking, marching, and swimming.</p>\n                        <p>The Nazi regime promoted a liberal code of conduct regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock.[380] Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. Soldier's wives were frequently involved in extramarital relationships. Sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer.[381] Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.</p>\n                        <p>With Hitler's approval, Himmler intended that the new society of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered by members of the SS, who were vetted for racial purity.[383] His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children.[383] The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes to accommodate single mothers during their pregnancies.[384] Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance.[384] The resulting children were often adopted into SS families.[384] The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and Nazi Party members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.</p>\n                        <p>Existing laws banning abortion except for medical reasons were strictly enforced by the Nazi regime. The number of abortions declined from 35,000 per year at the start of the 1930s to fewer than 2,000 per year at the end of the decade, though in 1935 a law was passed allowing abortions for eugenics reasons.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art21\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Health</h4>\n                        <p>Nazi Germany had a strong anti-tobacco movement, as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between smoking and lung cancer.[387] The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets.[388] Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains, and among on-duty members of the military.[389] Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides.[390] As part of a general public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products, and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.</p>\n                        <p>Government-run health care insurance plans were available, but Jews were denied coverage starting in 1933. That same year, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat government-insured patients. In 1937, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat non-Jewish patients, and in 1938 their right to practice medicine was removed entirely.</p>\n                        <p>Medical experiments, many of them pseudoscientific, were performed on concentration camp inmates beginning in 1941.[393] The most notorious doctor to perform medical experiments was SS-Hauptsturmführer Dr. Josef Mengele, camp doctor at Auschwitz.[394] Many of his victims died or were intentionally killed.[395] Concentration camp inmates were made available for purchase by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing and other experiments.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art22\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Environmentalism</h4>\n                        <p>Nazi society had elements supportive of animal rights and many people were fond of zoos and wildlife.[397] The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research.[398] The law was only loosely enforced, and in spite of a ban on vivisection, the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.</p>\n                        <p>The Reich Forestry Office under Göring enforced regulations that required foresters to plant a variety of trees to ensure suitable habitat for wildlife, and a new Reich Animal Protection Act became law in 1933.[400] The regime enacted the Reich Nature Protection Act in 1935 to protect the natural landscape from excessive economic development. It allowed for the expropriation of privately owned land to create nature preserves and aided in long-range planning.[401] Perfunctory efforts were made to curb air pollution, but little enforcement of existing legislation was undertaken once the war began.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art23\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Oppression of churches</h4>\n                        <p>When the Nazis seized power in 1933, roughly 67 percent of the population of Germany was Protestant, 33 percent was Roman Catholic, while Jews made up less than 1 percent.[403][404] According to 1939 census, 54 percent considered themselves Protestant, 40 percent Roman Catholic, 3.5 percent Gottgläubig (God-believing; a Nazi religious movement) and 1.5 percent nonreligious.</p>\n                        <p>Under the Gleichschaltung process, Hitler attempted to create a unified Protestant Reich Church from Germany's 28 existing Protestant state churches,[405] with the ultimate goal of eradication of the churches in Germany.[406] Pro-Nazi Ludwig Müller was installed as Reich Bishop and the pro-Nazi pressure group German Christians gained control of the new church.[407] They objected to the Old Testament because of its Jewish origins and demanded that converted Jews be barred from their church.[408] Pastor Martin Niemöller responded with the formation of the Confessing Church, from which some clergymen opposed the Nazi regime.[409] When in 1935 the Confessing Church synod protested the Nazi policy on religion, 700 of their pastors were arrested.[410] Müller resigned and Hitler appointed Hanns Kerrl as Minister for Church Affairs to continue efforts to control Protestantism.[411] In 1936, a Confessing Church envoy protested to Hitler against the religious persecutions and human rights abuses.[410] Hundreds more pastors were arrested.[411] The church continued to resist and by early 1937 Hitler abandoned his hope of uniting the Protestant churches.[410] Niemöller was arrested on 1 July 1937 and spent most of the next seven years in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and Dachau.[412] Theological universities were closed and pastors and theologians of other Protestant denominations were also arrested.</p>\n                        <p>Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover.[414] Hitler moved quickly to eliminate political Catholicism, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned Bavarian People's Party and Catholic Centre Party, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July.[415] The Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing harassment of the church in Germany.[312] The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.[416] Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious.[417] Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality.[418] Several Catholic leaders were targeted in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations.[419][420] Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets.[421] Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.</p>\n                        <p>Pope Pius XI had the \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (\"With Burning Concern\") encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit as it denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church.[418][423] In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. Enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities.[424] Later Catholic protests included the 22 March 1942 pastoral letter by the German bishops on \"The Struggle against Christianity and the Church\".[425] About 30 percent of Catholic priests were disciplined by police during the Nazi era.[426][427] A vast security network spied on the activities of clergy and priests were frequently denounced, arrested or sent to concentration camps – many to the dedicated clergy barracks at Dachau.[428] In the areas of Poland annexed in 1939, the Nazis instigated a brutal suppression and systematic dismantling of the Catholic Church.</p>\n                        <p>Alfred Rosenberg, head of the Nazi Party Office of Foreign Affairs and Hitler's appointed cultural and educational leader for Nazi Germany, considered Catholicism to be among the Nazis' chief enemies. He planned the \"extermination of the foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany\", and for the Bible and Christian cross to be replaced in all churches, cathedrals, and chapels with copies of Mein Kampf and the swastika. Other sects of Christianity were also targeted, with Chief of the Nazi Party Chancellery Martin Bormann publicly proclaiming in 1941, \"National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable.\"[406] Shirer writes that opposition to Christianity within Party leadership was so pronounced that, \"the Nazi regime intended to eventually destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists.\"</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art24\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Resistance to the regime</h4>\n                        <p>While no unified resistance movement opposing the Nazi regime existed, acts of defiance such as sabotage and labour slowdowns took place, as well as attempts to overthrow the regime or assassinate Hitler.[431] The banned Communist and Social Democratic parties set up resistance networks in the mid-1930s. These networks achieved little beyond fomenting unrest and initiating short-lived strikes.[432] Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who initially supported Hitler, changed his mind in 1936 and was later a participant in the July 20 plot.[433][434] The Red Orchestra spy ring provided information to the Allies about Nazi war crimes, helped orchestrate escapes from Germany, and distributed leaflets. The group was detected by the Gestapo and more than 50 members were tried and executed in 1942.[435] Communist and Social Democratic resistance groups resumed activity in late 1942, but were unable to achieve much beyond distributing leaflets. The two groups saw themselves as potential rival parties in post-war Germany, and for the most part did not co-ordinate their activities.[436] The White Rose resistance group was primarily active in 1942–43, and many of its members were arrested or executed, with the final arrests taking place in 1944.[437] Another civilian resistance group, the Kreisau Circle, had some connections with the military conspirators, and many of its members were arrested after the failed 20 July plot.</p>\n                        <p>While civilian efforts had an impact on public opinion, the army was the only organisation with the capacity to overthrow the government.[439][440] A major plot by men in the upper echelons of the military originated in 1938. They believed Britain would go to war over Hitler's planned invasion of Czechoslovakia, and Germany would lose. The plan was to overthrow Hitler or possibly assassinate him. Participants included Generaloberst Ludwig Beck, Generaloberst Walther von Brauchitsch, Generaloberst Franz Halder, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and Generalleutnant Erwin von Witzleben, who joined a conspiracy headed by Oberstleutnant Hans Oster and Major Helmuth Groscurth of the Abwehr. The planned coup was cancelled after the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938.[441] Many of the same people were involved in a coup planned for 1940, but again the participants changed their minds and backed down, partly because of the popularity of the regime after the early victories in the war.[442][443] Attempts to assassinate Hitler resumed in earnest in 1943, with Henning von Tresckow joining Oster's group and attempting to blow up Hitler's plane in 1943. Several more attempts followed before the failed 20 July 1944 plot, which was at least partly motivated by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war.[444][445] The plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, involved Claus von Stauffenberg planting a bomb in the conference room at Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler, who narrowly survived, later ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people.</p>\n                        <p>Around 1940 a resistance group formed around the priest Heinrich Maier. The group passed on locations of production facilities for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks, and aircraft to the Allies from late 1943 onwards. Allied bombers used this information to carry out air attacks. The Maier group provided information about the mass murder of Jews very early on; these reports were not initially believed by the Allies. The resistance group was uncovered and most of its members were imprisoned, tortured, or killed.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec08\">\n                    <h3>Culture</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn25\" disabled=\"\">Summary</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn26\">Censorship</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn27\">Architecture and art</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn28\">Film</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art25\">\n                        <h4>Summary</h4>\n                        <p>The regime promoted the concept of Volksgemeinschaft, a national German ethnic community. The goal was to build a classless society based on racial purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare, conquest and a struggle against Marxism.[449][450] The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude (KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. As well as taking control of tens of thousands of privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.</p>\n                        <p>The Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) was organised under the control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts, and many emigrated. Books and scripts had to be approved by the Propaganda Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.</p>\n                        <p>Radio became popular in Germany during the 1930s; over 70 percent of households owned a receiver by 1939, more than any other country. By July 1933, radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable.[454] Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art26\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Censorship</h4>\n                        <p>Newspapers, like other media, were controlled by the state; the Reich Press Chamber shut down or bought newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over two-thirds of the newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry.[457] The Nazi Party daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter (\"Ethnic Observer\"), was edited by Rosenberg, who also wrote The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority.[458] Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. Under Goebbels, the Propaganda Ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely, especially regarding what to omit.[459] Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.[460] Propaganda became less effective towards the end of the war, as people were able to obtain information outside of official channels.</p>\n                        <p>Authors of books left the country in droves and some wrote material critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths and the concept of blood and soil. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books—most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters—had been banned by the Nazi regime.[462] Nazi book burnings took place; nineteen such events were held on the night of 10 May 1933.[456] Tens of thousands of books from dozens of figures, including Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Helen Keller, Alfred Kerr, Marcel Proust, Erich Maria Remarque, Upton Sinclair, Jakob Wassermann, H. G. Wells, and Émile Zola were publicly burned. Pacifist works, and literature espousing liberal, democratic values were targeted for destruction, as well as any writings supporting the Weimar Republic or those written by Jewish authors.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art27\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Architecture and art</h4>\n                        <p>Hitler took a personal interest in architecture and worked closely with state architects Paul Troost and Albert Speer to create public buildings in a neoclassical style based on Roman architecture.[464][465] Speer constructed imposing structures such as the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and a new Reich Chancellery building in Berlin.[466] Hitler's plans for rebuilding Berlin included a gigantic dome based on the Pantheon in Rome and a triumphal arch more than double the height of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Neither structure was built.</p>\n                        <p>Hitler's belief that abstract, Dadaist, expressionist and modern art were decadent became the basis for policy.[468] Many art museum directors lost their posts in 1933 and were replaced by party members.[469] Some 6,500 modern works of art were removed from museums and replaced with works chosen by a Nazi jury.[470] Exhibitions of the rejected pieces, under titles such as \"Decadence in Art\", were launched in sixteen different cities by 1935. The Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, ran in Munich from July to November 1937. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.</p>\n                        <p>Composer Richard Strauss was appointed president of the Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933.[472] As was the case with other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable and for the most part disapproved of music that was too modern or atonal.[473] Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled.[474] Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories, and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933 to 1942.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art28\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Film</h4>\n                        <p>Movies were popular in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over a billion people in 1942, 1943 and 1944.[476][477] By 1934, German regulations restricting currency exports made it impossible for US film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.</p>\n                        <p>Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that influenced later films. New techniques such as telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of Nazi ideals.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec09\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn29\" disabled=\"\">Background</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn30\">Nazi seizure of power</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn31\">Nazification of Germany</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn32\">Consolidation of power</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn33\">Military build-up</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn34\">World War II</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn35\">Legacy</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art29\">\n                        <h4>Background</h4>\n                        <p>Germany was known as the Weimar Republic during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a republic with a semi-presidential system. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the Allied victors of World War I, and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.[6] Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of reparations payments required under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.[7] When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr and widespread civil unrest followed.</p>\n                        <p>The National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei), commonly known as the Nazi Party, was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the German Workers' Party (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several far-right political parties then active in Germany.[9] The Nazi Party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism.[10] They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.[11] The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the Völkisch movement.[12] The party, especially its paramilitary organisation Sturmabteilung (SA; Storm Detachment), or Brownshirts, used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members as well as Jewish people on the streets.[13] Such far-right armed groups were common in Bavaria, and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of Gustav Ritter von Kahr.</p>\n                        <p>When the stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929, the effect in Germany was dire.[15] Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the Nazis prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.[16] Many voters decided the Nazi Party was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the federal election of 1932, the party was the largest in the Reichstag, holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art30\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Nazi seizure of power</h4>\n                        <p>Although the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the German National People's Party.[18] Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung (\"seizure of power\").</p>\n                        <p>On the night of 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set afire. Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The Reichstag Fire Decree, imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure. Violent suppression of communists by the SA was undertaken nationwide and 4,000 members of the Communist Party of Germany were arrested.</p>\n                        <p>In March 1933, the Enabling Act, an amendment to the Weimar Constitution, passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.[21] This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.[22] As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used intimidation tactics as well as the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, and the Communists had already been banned.[23][24] On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats, and they were banned on 22 June.[25] On 21 June, the SA raided the offices of the German National People's Party – their former coalition partners – which then disbanded on 29 June. The remaining major political parties followed suit. On 14 July 1933 Germany became a one-party state with the passage of a law decreeing the Nazi Party to be the sole legal party in Germany. The founding of new parties was also made illegal, and all remaining political parties which had not already been dissolved were banned.[26] The Enabling Act would subsequently serve as the legal foundation for the dictatorship the Nazis established.[27] Further elections in November 1933, 1936, and 1938 were Nazi-controlled, with only members of the Party and a small number of independents elected.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art31\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Nazification of Germany</h4>\n                        <p>The Hitler cabinet used the terms of the Reichstag Fire Decree and later the Enabling Act to initiate the process of Gleichschaltung (\"co-ordination\"), which brought all aspects of life under party control.[29] Individual states not controlled by elected Nazi governments or Nazi-led coalitions were forced to agree to the appointment of Reich Commissars to bring the states in line with the policies of the central government. These Commissars had the power to appoint and remove local governments, state parliaments, officials, and judges. In this way Germany became a de facto unitary state, with all state governments controlled by the central government under the Nazis.[30][31] The state parliaments and the Reichsrat (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934,[32] with all state powers being transferred to the central government.</p>\n                        <p>All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members; these civic organisations either merged with the Nazi Party or faced dissolution.[33] The Nazi government declared a \"Day of National Labor\" for May Day 1933, and invited many trade union delegates to Berlin for celebrations. The day after, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country; all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested.[34] The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed in April, removed from their jobs all teachers, professors, judges, magistrates, and government officials who were Jewish or whose commitment to the party was suspect.[35] This meant the only non-political institutions not under control of the Nazis were the churches.</p>\n                        <p>The Nazi regime abolished the symbols of the Weimar Republic—including the black, red, and gold tricolour flag—and adopted reworked symbolism. The previous imperial black, white, and red tricolour was restored as one of Germany's two official flags; the second was the swastika flag of the Nazi Party, which became the sole national flag in 1935. The Party anthem \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" (\"Horst Wessel Song\") became a second national anthem.</p>\n                        <p>Germany was still in a dire economic situation, as six million people were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting.[38] Using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken beginning in 1934, creating 1.7 million new jobs by the end of that year alone.[38] Average wages began to rise.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art32\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Consolidation of power</h4>\n                        <p>The SA leadership continued to apply pressure for greater political and military power. In response, Hitler used the Schutzstaffel (SS) and Gestapo to purge the entire SA leadership.[40] Hitler targeted SA Stabschef (Chief of Staff) Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who—along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher)—were arrested and shot.[41] Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives.</p>\n                        <p>On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died. The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the \"Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich\", which stated that upon Hindenburg's death the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor.[43] Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (\"Leader and Chancellor\"), although eventually Reichskanzler was dropped.[44] Germany was now a totalitarian state with Hitler at its head.[45] As head of state, Hitler became Supreme Commander of the armed forces. The new law provided an altered loyalty oath for servicemen so that they affirmed loyalty to Hitler personally rather than the office of supreme commander or the state.[46] On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 percent of the electorate in a plebiscite.</p>\n                        <p>Most Germans were relieved that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and plenty for all in a united, Marxist-free country without the constraints of the Versailles Treaty.[48] The Nazi Party obtained and legitimised power through its initial revolutionary activities, then through manipulation of legal mechanisms, the use of police powers, and by taking control of the state and federal institutions.[49][50] The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933.[51] Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created by the end of the war.</p>\n                        <p>Beginning in April 1933, scores of measures defining the status of Jews and their rights were instituted.[53] These measures culminated in the establishment of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which stripped them of their basic rights.[54] The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews, and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as law, medicine, or education). Eventually the Nazis declared the Jews as undesirable to remain among German citizens and society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art33\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Military build-up</h4>\n                        <p>In the early years of the regime, Germany was without allies, and its military was drastically weakened by the Versailles Treaty. France, Poland, Italy, and the Soviet Union each had reasons to object to Hitler's rise to power. Poland suggested to France that the two nations engage in a preventive war against Germany in March 1933. Fascist Italy objected to German claims in the Balkans and on Austria, which Benito Mussolini considered to be in Italy's sphere of influence.</p>\n                        <p>As early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must begin, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. On 17 May 1933, Hitler gave a speech before the Reichstag outlining his desire for world peace and accepted an offer from American President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military disarmament, provided the other nations of Europe did the same.[57] When the other European powers failed to accept this offer, Hitler pulled Germany out of the World Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations in October, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair if they applied only to Germany.[58] In a referendum held in November, 95 percent of voters supported Germany's withdrawal.</p>\n                        <p>In 1934, Hitler told his military leaders that a war in the east should begin in 1942.[60] The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany.[61] In March 1935, Hitler announced the creation of an air force, and that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men.[62] Britain agreed to Germany building a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.</p>\n                        <p>When the Italian invasion of Ethiopia led to only mild protests by the British and French governments, on 7 March 1936 Hitler used the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance as a pretext to order the army to march 3,000 troops into the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in violation of the Versailles Treaty.[64] As the territory was part of Germany, the British and French governments did not feel that attempting to enforce the treaty was worth the risk of war.[65] In the one-party election held on 29 March, the Nazis received 98.9 percent support.[65] In 1936, Hitler signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan and a non-aggression agreement with Mussolini, who was soon referring to a \"Rome-Berlin Axis\".</p>\n                        <p>Hitler sent military supplies and assistance to the Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War, which began in July 1936. The German Condor Legion included a range of aircraft and their crews, as well as a tank contingent. The aircraft of the Legion destroyed the city of Guernica in 1937.[67] The Nationalists were victorious in 1939 and became an informal ally of Nazi Germany.</p>\n                        <h5>Austria and Czechoslovakia</h5>\n                        <p>In February 1938, Hitler emphasised to Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg the need for Germany to secure its frontiers. Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite regarding Austrian independence for 13 March, but Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian Nazi Party or face an invasion. German troops entered Austria the next day, to be greeted with enthusiasm by the populace.</p>\n                        <p>The Republic of Czechoslovakia was home to a substantial minority of Germans, who lived mostly in the Sudetenland. Under pressure from separatist groups within the Sudeten German Party, the Czechoslovak government offered economic concessions to the region.[70] Hitler decided not just to incorporate the Sudetenland into the Reich, but to destroy the country of Czechoslovakia entirely.[71] The Nazis undertook a propaganda campaign to try to generate support for an invasion.[72] Top German military leaders opposed the plan, as Germany was not yet ready for war.</p>\n                        <p>The crisis led to war preparations by Britain, Czechoslovakia, and France (Czechoslovakia's ally). Attempting to avoid war, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain arranged a series of meetings, the result of which was the Munich Agreement, signed on 29 September 1938. The Czechoslovak government was forced to accept the Sudetenland's annexation into Germany. Chamberlain was greeted with cheers when he landed in London, saying the agreement brought \"peace for our time\".[74] In addition to the German annexation, Poland seized a narrow strip of land near Cieszyn on 2 October, while as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, Hungary demanded and received 12,000 square kilometres (4,600 sq mi) along their northern border in the First Vienna Award on 2 November.[75] Following negotiations with President Emil Hácha, Hitler seized the rest of the Czech half of the country on 15 March 1939 and created the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, one day after the proclamation of the Slovak Republic in the Slovak half.[76] Also on 15 March, Hungary occupied and annexed the recently proclaimed and unrecognized Carpatho-Ukraine and an additional sliver of land disputed with Slovakia.</p>\n                        <p>Austrian and Czech foreign exchange reserves were seized by the Nazis, as were stockpiles of raw materials such as metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft, which were shipped to Germany. The Reichswerke Hermann Göring industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries.</p>\n                        <h5>Poland</h5>\n                        <p>In January 1934, Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Poland.[80] In March 1939, Hitler demanded the return of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The British announced they would come to the aid of Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for September 1939.[81] On 23 May, Hitler described to his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland. He expected this time they would be met by force.</p>\n                        <p>The Germans reaffirmed their alliance with Italy and signed non-aggression pacts with Denmark, Estonia, and Latvia whilst trade links were formalised with Romania, Norway, and Sweden.[83] Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arranged in negotiations with the Soviet Union a non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in August 1939.[84] The treaty also contained secret protocols dividing Poland and the Baltic states into German and Soviet spheres of influence.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art34\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>World War II</h4>\n                        <h5>Foreign policy</h5>\n                        <p>Germany's wartime foreign policy involved the creation of allied governments controlled directly or indirectly from Berlin. They intended to obtain soldiers from allies such as Italy and Hungary and workers and food supplies from allies such as Vichy France.[86] Hungary was the fourth nation to join the Axis, signing the Tripartite Pact on 27 September 1940. Bulgaria signed the pact on 17 November. German efforts to secure oil included negotiating a supply from their new ally, Romania, who signed the Pact on 23 November, alongside the Slovak Republic.[87][88][89] By late 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy, and 10 from Hungary.[90] Germany assumed full control in France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was a powerful ally, the relationship was distant, with little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.</p>\n                        <h5>Outbreak of war</h5>\n                        <p>Germany invaded Poland and captured the Free City of Danzig on 1 September 1939, beginning World War II in Europe.[92] Honouring their treaty obligations, Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later.[93] Poland fell quickly, as the Soviet Union attacked from the east on 17 September.[94] Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; Security Police) and Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), ordered on 21 September that Polish Jews should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport them further east, or possibly to Madagascar.[95] Using lists prepared in advance, some 65,000 Polish intelligentsia, noblemen, clergy, and teachers were killed by the end of 1939 in an attempt to destroy Poland's identity as a nation.[96][97] Soviet forces advanced into Finland in the Winter War, and German forces saw action at sea. But little other activity occurred until May, so the period became known as the \"Phoney War\".</p>\n                        <p>From the start of the war, a British blockade on shipments to Germany affected its economy. Germany was particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal, and grain.[99] Thanks to trade embargoes and the blockade, imports into Germany declined by 80 per cent.[100] To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered the invasion of Denmark and Norway, which began on 9 April. Denmark fell after less than a day, while most of Norway followed by the end of the month.[101][102] By early June, Germany occupied all of Norway.</p>\n                        <h5>Conquest of Europe</h5>\n                        <p>Against the advice of many of his senior military officers, in May 1940 Hitler ordered an attack on France and the Low Countries.[104][105] They quickly conquered Luxembourg and the Netherlands and outmanoeuvred the Allies in Belgium, forcing the evacuation of many British and French troops at Dunkirk.[106] France fell as well, surrendering to Germany on 22 June.[107] The victory in France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and an upsurge in war fever in Germany.</p>\n                        <p>In violation of the provisions of the Hague Convention, industrial firms in the Netherlands, France, and Belgium were put to work producing war materiel for Germany.</p>\n                        <p>The Nazis seized from the French thousands of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles of weapons, and raw materials such as copper, tin, oil, and nickel.[110] Payments for occupation costs were levied upon France, Belgium, and Norway.[111] Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets, and uncertainty about the future.[112] Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most of Europe.[113] Famine was experienced in many occupied countries.</p>\n                        <p>Hitler's peace overtures to the new British Prime Minister Winston Churchill were rejected in July 1940. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder had advised Hitler in June that air superiority was a pre-condition for a successful invasion of Britain, so Hitler ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force (RAF) airbases and radar stations, as well as nightly air raids on British cities, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the RAF in what became known as the Battle of Britain, and by the end of October, Hitler realised that air superiority would not be achieved. He permanently postponed the invasion, a plan which the commanders of the German army had never taken entirely seriously.[114][115][k] Several historians, including Andrew Gordon, believe the primary reason for the failure of the invasion plan was the superiority of the Royal Navy, not the actions of the RAF.</p>\n                        <p>In February 1941, the German Afrika Korps arrived in Libya to aid the Italians in the North African Campaign.[117] On 6 April, Germany launched an invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece.[118][119] All of Yugoslavia and parts of Greece were subsequently divided between Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Bulgaria.</p>\n                        <h5>Invasion of the Soviet Union</h5>\n                        <p>On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, about 3.8 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union.[122] In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive—codenamed Operation Barbarossa—was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers.[123] The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the war would continue or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.</p>\n                        <p>The invasion conquered a huge area, including the Baltic states, Belarus, and west Ukraine. After the successful Battle of Smolensk in September 1941, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kyiv.[125] This pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves. The Moscow offensive, which resumed in October 1941, ended disastrously in December.[126] On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Germany declared war on the United States.</p>\n                        <p>Food was in short supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, as the retreating armies had burned the crops in some areas, and much of the remainder was sent back to the Reich.[128] In Germany, rations were cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was good, and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.</p>\n                        <p>Germany and Europe as a whole were almost totally dependent on foreign oil imports.[130] In an attempt to resolve the shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau (\"Case Blue\"), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields.[131] The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who were trapped in Stalingrad on 23 November.[132] Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but this turned out to be infeasible.[133] Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war.</p>\n                        <h5>Turning point and collapse</h5>\n                        <p>Losses continued to mount after Stalingrad, leading to a sharp reduction in the popularity of the Nazi Party and deteriorating morale. [135] Soviet forces continued to push westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943. By the end of 1943, the Germans had lost most of their eastern territorial gains.[136] In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were defeated by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942.[137] The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September.[138] Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany. Many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets in an effort to destroy German morale.[139] The bombing of aircraft factories as well as Peenemünde Army Research Center, where V-1 and V-2 rockets were being developed and produced, were also deemed particularly important.[140][141] German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses, and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.</p>\n                        <p>On 6 June 1944, American, British, and Canadian forces established a front in France with the D-Day landings in Normandy.[143] On 20 July 1944, Hitler survived an assassination attempt.[144] He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000 arrests and the execution of more than 4,900 people.[145] The failed Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was the last major German offensive on the western front, and Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January.[146] Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the war's closing months.[147] Through his Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack, Hitler ordered that anyone who was not prepared to fight should be court-martialed, and thousands of people were put to death.[148] In many areas, people surrendered to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue to fight. Hitler ordered the destruction of transport, bridges, industries, and other infrastructure—a scorched earth decree—but Armaments Minister Albert Speer prevented this order from being fully carried out.</p>\n                        <p>During the Battle of Berlin (16 April 1945 – 2 May 1945), Hitler and his staff lived in the underground Führerbunker while the Red Army approached.[149] On 30 April, when Soviet troops were within two blocks of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler, along with his girlfriend and by then wife Eva Braun committed suicide.[150] On 2 May, General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov.[151] Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor.[152] Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide the next day after murdering their six children.[153] Between 4 and 8 May 1945, most of the remaining German armed forces unconditionally surrendered. The German Instrument of Surrender was signed 8 May, marking the end of the Nazi regime and the end of World War II in Europe.</p>\n                        <p>Popular support for Hitler almost completely disappeared as the war drew to a close.[155] Suicide rates in Germany increased, particularly in areas where the Red Army was advancing. Among soldiers and party personnel, suicide was often deemed an honourable and heroic alternative to surrender. First-hand accounts and propaganda about the uncivilised behaviour of the advancing Soviet troops caused panic among civilians on the Eastern Front, especially women, who feared being raped.[156] More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians, and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead),[157] and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.</p>\n                        <h5>German casualties</h5>\n                        <p>Estimates of the total German war dead range from 5.5 to 6.9 million persons.[159] A study by German historian Rüdiger Overmans puts the number of German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders.[160] Richard Overy estimated in 2014 that about 353,000 civilians were killed in Allied air raids.[161] Other civilian deaths include 300,000 Germans (including Jews) who were victims of Nazi political, racial, and religious persecution[162] and 200,000 who were murdered in the Nazi euthanasia program.[163] Political courts called Sondergerichte sentenced some 12,000 members of the German resistance to death, and civil courts sentenced an additional 40,000 Germans.[164] Mass rapes of German women also took place.</p>\n                    </div>                    \n                    <div id=\"art35\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Legacy</h4>\n                        <p>The Allied powers organised war crimes trials, beginning with the Nuremberg trials, held from November 1945 to October 1946, of 23 top Nazi officials. They were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity—in violation of international laws governing warfare.[481] All but three of the defendants were found guilty and twelve were sentenced to death.[482] Twelve Subsequent Nuremberg trials of 184 defendants were held between 1946 and 1949.[481] Between 1946 and 1949, the Allies investigated 3,887 cases, of which 489 were brought to trial. The result was convictions of 1,426 people; 297 of these were sentenced to death and 279 to life in prison, with the remainder receiving lesser sentences. About 65 percent of the death sentences were carried out.[483] Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, for example prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial.</p>\n                        <p>The political programme espoused by Hitler and the Nazis brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Europe. Germany itself suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour).[485] The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.[486] As a result, Nazi ideology and the actions taken by the regime are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral.[487] Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word \"evil\" to describe Hitler and the Nazi regime.[488] Interest in Nazi Germany continues in the media and the academic world. While Evans remarks that the era \"exerts an almost universal appeal because its murderous racism stands as a warning to the whole of humanity\",[489] young neo-Nazis enjoy the shock value that Nazi symbols or slogans provide.[490] The display or use of Nazi symbolism such as flags, swastikas, or greetings is illegal in Germany and Austria.</p>\n                        <p>Nazi Germany was succeeded by three states: West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany or \"FRG\"), East Germany (the German Democratic Republic or \"GRD\"), and Austria.[492] The process of denazification, which was initiated by the Allies as a way to remove Nazi Party members was only partially successful, as the need for experts in such fields as medicine and engineering was too great. However, expression of Nazi views was frowned upon, and those who expressed such views were frequently dismissed from their jobs.[493] From the immediate post-war period through the 1950s, people avoided talking about the Nazi regime or their own wartime experiences. While virtually every family suffered losses during the war has a story to tell, Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense of communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes.</p>\n                        <p>The trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 and the broadcast of the television miniseries Holocaust in 1979 brought the process of Vergangenheitsbewältigung (coping with the past) to the forefront for many Germans.[490][494] Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has led to the development of a strong democracy in Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.</p>\n                        <p>In 2017 a Körber Foundation survey found that 40 percent of 14-year-olds in Germany did not know what Auschwitz was.[495] The journalist Alan Posener attributed the country's \"growing historical amnesia\" in part to a failure by the German film and television industry to reflect the country's history accurately.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">Nazi Germany</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">German Reich</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">1933-1945</h2>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_year\">Germany: 1933-1945</h3>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_nazi.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of Nazi Germany</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>Berlin</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">Nazi Germany</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">Geography</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec03\">Politics</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec04\">Military and paramilitary</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec05\">Economy</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec06\">Racial policy and eugenics</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec07\">Society</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec08\">Culture</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec09\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td><ul><li>633,786 km<sup>2</sup> (1939)</li><li>823,505 km<sup>2</sup> (1940)</li></ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td><ul><li>UTC+1 (1939)</li><li>UTC-UTC+2 (1942)</li></ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_nazi.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map of Nazi Germany (late 1942)</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td><ul><li>79,375,281 (1939)</li><li>109,518,183 (1940)</li></ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Protestant (54%)</li>\n                                <li>Roman Catholic (40%)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Languages</th>\n                        <td>German</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>Reichsmark</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>Unitary Nazi one-party fascist state under a totalitarian dictatorship</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Head of State, Chancellor</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Paul von Hindenburg (Head of State, 1933-1934)</li>\n                                <li>Adolf Hitler (Head of State, 1934-1945)</li>\n                                <li>Karl Dönitz (Head of State, 1945)</li>\n                                <li>Adolf Hitler (Chancellor, 1933-1945)</li>\n                                <li>Joseph Goebbels (Chancellor, 1945)</li>\n                                <li>L.

The four powers divided \"Germany as a whole\" into four occupation zones for administrative purposes under the three Western Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom, France) and the Soviet Union, respectively. This division was ratified at the August 1945 Potsdam Conference.[citation needed] The four zones were agreed by the United States, United Kingdom and Soviet Union at the February 1945 Yalta Conference, setting aside an earlier division into three zones (excluding France) proposed by the September 1944 London Protocol.</p>\n                   <p>Deviating from the occupation zones planned according to the London Protocol in 1944, at Potsdam, the United States, United Kingdom and the Soviet Union approved the detachment from Germany of the territories east of the Oder–Neisse line, with the exact line of the boundary to be determined in a final German peace treaty. This treaty was expected to confirm the shifting westward of Poland's borders, as the United Kingdom and United States committed themselves to support the permanent incorporation of eastern Germany into Poland and the Soviet Union. From March 1945 to July 1945, these former eastern territories of Germany had been administered under Soviet military occupation authorities, but following the Potsdam Conference they were handed over to Soviet and Polish civilian administrations and ceased to constitute part of Allied-occupied Germany.</p>\n                   <p>In the closing weeks of fighting in Europe, United States forces had pushed beyond the agreed boundaries for the future zones of occupation, in some places by as much as 320 km (200 miles). The so-called line of contact between Soviet and U.S. forces at the end of hostilities, mostly lying eastward of the July 1945-established inner German border, was temporary. After two months in which they had held areas that had been assigned to the Soviet zone, U.S. forces withdrew in the first days of July 1945.[2] Some have concluded that this was a crucial move that persuaded the Soviet Union to allow American, British and French forces into their designated sectors in Berlin, which occurred at roughly the same time, although the need for intelligence gathering (Operation Paperclip) may also have been a factor.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Occupation</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Territories annexed by Germany between 1938 and 1945</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Occupation zones</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Berlin</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Other German territory</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Territories annexed by Germany between 1938 and 1945</h4>\n                        <p>All territories annexed by Germany before the war from Austria and Czechoslovakia were returned to these countries.

Licenses were granted to Germans not involved in Nazi propaganda to establish those newspapers, including Frankfurter Rundschau (August 1945), Der Tagesspiegel (Berlin; September 1945), and Süddeutsche Zeitung (Munich; October 1945). Radio stations were run by the military government. Later, Radio Frankfurt, Radio München (Munich) and Radio Stuttgart gave way for the Hessischer Rundfunk, Bayerischer Rundfunk, and Süddeutscher Rundfunk, respectively. The RIAS in West-Berlin remained a radio station under U.S. control.</p>\n                        <h5>British Zone</h5>\n                        <p>By May 1945 the British and Canadian Armies had liberated the Netherlands and had conquered Northern Germany.

The Control Commission for Germany (British Element) (CCG/BE) ceded more slices of its area of occupation to the Soviet Union – specifically the Amt Neuhaus of Hanover and some exclaves and fringes of Brunswick, for example the County of Blankenburg, and exchanged some villages between British Holstein and Soviet Mecklenburg under the Barber-Lyashchenko Agreement.</p>\n                        <p>Within the British Zone of Occupation, the CCG/BE re-established the German state of Hamburg, but with borders that had been drawn by Nazi Germany in 1937. The British also created the new German states of:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>Schleswig-Holstein – emerging in 1946 from the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein;</li>\n                            <li>Lower Saxony – the merger of Brunswick, Oldenburg, and Schaumburg-Lippe with the state of Hanover in 1946; and</li>\n                            <li>North Rhine-Westphalia – the merger of Lippe with the Prussian provinces of the Rhineland (northern part) and Westphalia – during 1946–47.</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <p>Also in 1947, the American Zone of Occupation being inland had no port facilities – thus the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and Bremerhaven became exclaves within the British Zone.</p>\n                        <p>At the end of October 1946, the British Zone had a population of:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>North Rhine-Westphalia 11.7 million</li>\n                            <li>Lower Saxony 6.2 million</li>\n                            <li>Schleswig-Holstein 2.6 million</li>\n                            <li>Hamburg 1.4 million</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <p>The British headquarters were originally based in Bad Oeynhausen from 1946, but in 1954 it was moved to Mönchengladbach where it was known as JHQ Rheindahlen.</p>\n                        <h5>French Zone</h5>\n                        <p>The French Republic was at first not granted an occupation zone in Germany, but the British and American governments later agreed to cede some western parts of their zones of occupation to the French Army.[8] In April and May 1945, the French 1st Army had captured Karlsruhe and Stuttgart, and conquered a territory extending to Hitler's Eagle's Nest and the westernmost part of Austria. In July, the French relinquished Stuttgart to the Americans, and in exchange were given control over cities west of the Rhine such as Mainz and Koblenz.[9] All this resulted in two barely contiguous areas of Germany along the French border which met at just a single point along the River Rhine. Three German states (Land) were established: Rheinland Pfalz in the North and West and on the other hand Württemberg-Hohenzollern and South Baden, who later formed Baden-Württemberg together with Württemberg-Baden of the American Zone.</p>\n                        <p>The French Zone of Occupation included the Saargebiet, which was disentangled from it on 16 February 1946. By 18 December 1946 customs controls were established between the Saar area and Allied-occupied Germany. The French zone ceded further areas adjacent to the Saar (in mid-1946, early 1947, and early 1949). Included in the French zone was the town of Büsingen am Hochrhein, a German exclave separated from the rest of the country by a narrow strip of neutral Swiss territory. The Swiss government agreed to allow limited numbers of French troops to pass through its territory in order to maintain law and order in Büsingen.</p>\n                        <p>At the end of October 1946, the French Zone had a population of:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>Rheinland Pfalz 2.7 million</li>\n                            <li>Baden (South Baden) 1.2 million</li>\n                            <li>Württemberg-Hohenzollern 1.05 million</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <h5>Soviet Zone of Occupation</h5>\n                        <p>The Soviet occupation zone incorporated Thuringia, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

A small area west of the Oder, near Szczecin, also fell to Poland. Most German citizens residing in these areas were subsequently expropriated and expelled.

The Saar was disengaged from the French zone on 16 February 1946. In the speech Restatement of Policy on Germany on 6 September 1946 the U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes stated the U.S.' motive in detaching the Saar from Germany as \"The United States does not feel that it can deny to France, which has been invaded three times by Germany in 70 years, its claim to the Saar territory.\"</p>\n                        <p>By 18 December 1946 customs controls were established between the Saar and Allied-occupied Germany. Most German citizens residing in the Saar area were allowed to stay and keep their property. Returning refugees, who had fled from war hostilities, were allowed to return; in particular, refugees who had fled the Nazi dictatorship were invited and welcomed to return to the Saar.</p>\n                        <p>The protectorate was a state nominally independent of Germany and France, but with its economy integrated into that of France. The Saar territory was enlarged at the expense of the French zone in mid-1946, early 1947 (when 61 municipalities were returned to the French zone), and early 1949. On 15 November 1947 the French currency became legal tender in the Saar Protectorate, followed by the full integration of the Saar into the French economy (customs union as of 23 March 1948). In July the Saar population was stripped of its German citizenship and became of Sarrois nationality.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn05\" disabled=\"\">Governance and the emergence of two German states</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn06\">Occupation policy</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn07\">Insurgency</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn08\">Expulsion policy</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\">\n                        <h4>Governance and the emergence of two German states</h4>\n                        <p>The original Allied plan to govern Germany as a single unit through the Allied Control Council broke down in 1946–1947 due to growing tensions between the Allies, with Britain and the US wishing cooperation, France obstructing any collaboration in order to partition Germany into many independent states, and the Soviet Union unilaterally implementing from early on elements of a Marxist political-economic system (enforced redistribution of land, nationalisation of businesses). Another dispute was the absorption of post-war expellees. While the UK, the US and the Soviet Union had agreed to accept, house and feed about six million expelled German citizens from former eastern Germany and four million expelled and denaturalised Czechoslovaks, Poles, Hungarians and Yugoslavs of German ethnicity in their zones, France generally had not agreed to the expulsions approved by the Potsdam agreement (a decision made without input from France). Therefore, France strictly refused to absorb war refugees who were denied return to their homes in seized eastern German territories or destitute post-war expellees who had been expropriated there, into the French zone, let alone into the separated Saar protectorate.[12] However, the native population, returning after Nazi-imposed removals (e.g., political and Jewish refugees) and war-related relocations (e.g., evacuation from air raids), were allowed to return home in the areas under French control. The other Allies complained that they had to shoulder the burden to feed, house and clothe the expellees who had to leave their belongings behind.</p>\n                        <p>In practice, each of the four occupying powers wielded government authority in their respective zones and carried out different policies toward the population and local and state governments there. A uniform administration of the western zones evolved, known first as the Bizone (the American and British zones merged as of 1 January 1947) and later the Trizone (after inclusion of the French zone). The complete breakdown of east–west allied cooperation and joint administration in Germany became clear with the Soviet imposition of the Berlin Blockade that was enforced from June 1948 to May 1949. The three western zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949, and the Soviets followed suit in October 1949 with the establishment of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).</p>\n                        <p>In the west, the occupation continued until 5 May 1955, when the General Treaty (German: Deutschlandvertrag) entered into force. However, upon the creation of the Federal Republic in May 1949, the military governors were replaced by civilian high commissioners, whose powers lay somewhere between those of a governor and those of an ambassador. When the Deutschlandvertrag became law, the occupation ended, the western occupation zones ceased to exist, and the high commissioners were replaced by normal ambassadors. West Germany was also allowed to build a military, and the Bundeswehr, or Federal Defense Force, was established on 12 November 1955.</p>\n                        <p>A similar situation occurred in East Germany. The GDR was founded on 7 October 1949. On 10 October the Soviet Military Administration in Germany was replaced by the Soviet Control Commission, although limited sovereignty was not granted to the GDR government until 11 November 1949. After the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953, the Soviet Control Commission was replaced with the office of the Soviet High Commissioner on 28 May 1953. This office was abolished (and replaced by an ambassador) and (general) sovereignty was granted to the GDR, when the Soviet Union concluded a state treaty (Staatsvertrag) with the GDR on 20 September 1955. On 1 March 1956, the GDR established a military, the National People's Army (NVA).</p>\n                        <p>Despite the grants of general sovereignty to both German states in 1955, full and unrestricted sovereignty under international law was not enjoyed by any German government until after the reunification of Germany in October 1990. Though West Germany was effectively independent, the western Allies maintained limited legal jurisdiction over 'Germany as a whole' in respect of West Germany and Berlin. At the same time, East Germany progressed from being a satellite state of the Soviet Union to increasing independence of action; while still deferring in matters of security to Soviet authority. The provisions of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, also known as the \"Two-plus-Four Treaty\", granting full sovereign powers to Germany did not become law until 15 March 1991, after all of the participating nations had ratified the treaty. As envisaged by the Treaty, the last occupation troops departed from Germany when the Russian presence was terminated in 1994, although the Belgian Forces in Germany stayed in German territory until the end of 2005.</p>\n                        <p>A 1956 plebiscite ended the French administration of the Saar protectorate, and it joined the Federal Republic as Saarland on 1 January 1957, becoming its tenth state.</p>\n                        <p>The city of Berlin was not part of either state and continued to be under Allied occupation until the reunification of Germany in October 1990. For administrative purposes, the three western sectors of Berlin were merged into the entity of West Berlin. The Soviet sector became known as East Berlin and while not recognised by the Western powers as a part of East Germany, the GDR declared it its capital (Hauptstadt der DDR).</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Occupation policy</h4>\n                        <p>At the end of the war, General Eisenhower issued a non-fraternization policy to troops under his command in occupied Germany. This policy was relaxed in stages. By June 1945 the prohibition on speaking with German children was made less strict. In July it became possible to speak to German adults in certain circumstances. In September the policy was completely dropped in Austria and Germany.</p>\n                        <p>Nevertheless, due to the large numbers of Disarmed Enemy Forces being held in Rheinwiesenlagers throughout western Germany, the Americans and the British – not the Soviets – used armed units of Feldgendarmerie to maintain control and discipline in the camps. In June 1946, these German military police units became the last Wehrmacht troops to surrender their arms to the western powers.</p>\n                        <p>By December 1945, over 100,000 German civilians were interned as security threats and for possible trial and sentencing as members of criminal organisations.</p>\n                        <p>The food situation in occupied Germany was initially very dire. By the spring of 1946 the official ration in the American zone was no more than 1,275 calories (5,330 kJ) per day, with some areas probably receiving as little as 700 calories (2,900 kJ) per day. In the British zone the food situation was dire, as found during a visit by the British (and Jewish) publisher Victor Gollancz in October and November 1946. In Düsseldorf the normal 28-day allocation should have been 1,548 calories (6,480 kJ) including 10 kilograms (22 lb) of bread, but as there was limited grain the bread ration was only 8.5 kilograms (19 lb). However, as there was only sufficient bread for about 50% of this \"called up\" ration, the total deficiency was about 50%, not 15% as stated in a ministerial reply in the British Parliament on 11 December. So only about 770 calories (3,200 kJ) would have been supplied, and he said the German winter ration would be 1,000 calories (4,200 kJ) as the recent increase was \"largely mythical\". His book includes photos taken on the visit and critical letters and newspaper articles by him published in several British newspapers; The Times, the Daily Herald, the Manchester Guardian, etc.</p>\n                        <p>Some occupation soldiers took advantage of the desperate food situation by exploiting their ample supply of food and cigarettes (the currency of the black market) to get to the local German girls as what became known as frau bait (The New York Times, 25 June 1945). Some soldiers still felt the girls were the enemy, but used them for sex nevertheless.</p>\n                        <p>The often destitute mothers of the resulting children usually received no child support. In the earliest stages of the occupation, U.S. soldiers were not allowed to pay maintenance for a child they admitted having fathered, since to do so was considered \"aiding the enemy\". Marriages between white U.S. soldiers and Austrian women were not permitted until January 1946, and with German women until December 1946.</p>\n                        <p>The children of African-American soldiers, commonly called Negermischlinge[15] (\"Negro half-breeds\"), comprising about three percent of the total number of children fathered by GIs, were particularly disadvantaged because of their inability to conceal the foreign identity of their father. For many white U.S. soldiers of this era, miscegenation even with an \"enemy\" white population was regarded as an intolerable outrage. African-American soldiers were therefore reluctant to admit to fathering such children since this would invite reprisals and even accusations of rape, a crime which was much more aggressively prosecuted by military authorities against African-Americans compared with Caucasian soldiers, much more likely to result in a conviction by court-martial (in part because a German woman was both less likely to acknowledge consensual sexual relations with an African-American and more likely to be believed if she alleged rape against an African-American) and which carried a potential death sentence. Even in the rare cases where an African-American soldier was willing to take responsibility for fathering a child, until 1948 the U.S. Army prohibited interracial marriages.[15] The mothers of the children would often face particularly harsh ostracism.</p>\n                        <p>Between 1950 and 1955, the Allied High Commission for Germany prohibited \"proceedings to establish paternity or liability for maintenance of children.\"[15] Even after the lifting of the ban West German courts had little power over American soldiers.</p>\n                        <p>In general, the British authorities were less strict than the Americans about fraternisation, whereas the French and Soviet authorities were more strict.</p>\n                        <p>While Allied servicemen were ordered to obey local laws while in Germany, soldiers could not be prosecuted by German courts for crimes committed against German citizens except as authorised by the occupation authorities. Invariably, when a soldier was accused of criminal behaviour the occupation authorities preferred to handle the matter within the military justice system. This sometimes led to harsher punishments than would have been available under German law – in particular, U.S. servicemen could be executed if court-martialed and convicted of rape.[16] See United States v.

Hungary had to yield to the pressure exerted mainly by the Soviet Union and by the Allied Control Council.[18] Millions of people were expelled from former eastern territories of Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and elsewhere to the occupation zones of the UK, US, and USSR, which agreed in the Potsdam Agreement to absorb the post-war expellees into their zones. Many remained in refugee camps for a long time. Some Germans remained in the Soviet Union and were used for forced labour for a period of years.</p>\n                        <p>France was not invited to the Potsdam Conference. As a result, it chose to adopt some decisions of the Potsdam Agreements and to dismiss others. France maintained the position that it did not approve post-war expulsions and that therefore it was not responsible to accommodate and nourish the destitute expellees in its zone. While the few war-related refugees who had reached the area to become the French zone before July 1945 were taken care of, the French military government for Germany refused to absorb post-war expellees deported from the East into its zone. In December 1946, the French military government for Germany absorbed into its zone German refugees from Denmark, where 250,000 Germans had found a refuge from the Soviets by sea vessels between February and May 1945.[12] These clearly were war-related refugees from the eastern parts of Germany however, and not post-war expellees.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">Allied-occupied Germany</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Alliierte Besetzung Deutschlands</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">1945–1949</h2>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_aog.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of Allied-occupied Germany</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>    \n                            <ul>\n                            <li>Berlin (de jure)</li>\n                            <li>Frankfurt (US zone)</li>\n                            <li>Bad Oeynhausen (British zone)</li>\n                            <li>Baden-Baden (French zone)</li>\n                            <li>East Berlin (Soviet zone)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">Allied-occupied Germany</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">Occupation</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec03\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td>357,022 km<sup>2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td>UTC+1</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_aog.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map of Allied-occupied Germany</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>64,260,000 (1945)</li>\n                                <li>68,080,000 (1949)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td>Unknown</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Languages</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                            <li>German</li>\n                            <li>English</li>\n                            <li>Russian</li>\n                            <li>French</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                            <li>Reichsmark (to 1948)</li>\n                            <li>Rentenmark (to 1948)</li>\n                            <li>Deutschmark (West: from 1948)</li>\n                            <li>East German Deutschmark (East: from 1948</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>Allied Control Council</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Governors</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Bernard Montgomery (UK)</li>\n                                <li>Dwight D.

Germany was stripped of its war gains. Germany was annexed some territories in East to Poland and the Soviet Union, and a territory in West (Saarland) to France until 1957. At the end of the war, there were some eight million foreign displaced persons in Germany;[1] mainly forced laborers and prisoners; including around 400,000 from the concentration camp system,[2] survivors from a much larger number who had died from starvation, harsh conditions, murder, or being worked to death. Over 10 million German-speaking refugees arrived in Germany from other countries in Central and Eastern Europe.[1] Some 9 million Germans were POWs,[3] many of whom were kept as forced laborers for several years to provide restitution to the countries Germany had devastated in the war, and some industrial equipment was removed as reparations.</p>\n                   <p>The Cold War (1947-1991) divided Germany into the United States-led Western Allies in West and the Soviet Union in East, these two regions could not be reunited until 1990. Germans did not have a central leadership until 1949 when the two countries emerged:</p>\n                   <ul>\n                       <li>Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), established on 23 May 1949, commonly known as West Germany, was a parliamentary democracy with a capitalist economic system and free churches and labor unions.</li>\n                       <li>German Democratic Republic (GDR), established on 7 October 1949, commonly known as East Germany, was the smaller Marxist–Leninist socialist republic with its totalitarian leadership dominated by the Soviet-aligned Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in order to retain it within the Soviet sphere of influence.</li>\n                   </ul>\n                   <p>After experiencing its Wirtschaftswunder or \"economic miracle\" in 1955, West Germany became the most prosperous economy in Europe[citation needed]. Under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, West Germany built strong relationships with France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Israel.[5] West Germany also joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Economic Community (later to become the European Union). East Germany stagnated as its economy was largely organized to meet the needs of the Soviet Union; the secret police (Stasi) tightly controlled daily life, and the Berlin Wall (1961) ended the steady flow of refugees to the West. The country was peacefully reunited on 3 October 1990 and Germany also has become a great power again in the world since that, following the decline and fall of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) as the ruling party of East Germany and the fall of communist East Germany (the GDR).</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>West Germany</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Summary</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">GNP growth 1950-1960</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">The Sixties: a time for reform</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn04\">Political developments 1969-1990</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Summary</h4>\n                        <p>The Western Allies turned over increasing authority to West German officials and moved to establish a nucleus for a future German government by creating a central Economic Council for their zones. The program later provided for a West German constituent assembly, an occupation statute governing relations between the Allies and the German authorities, and the political and economic merger of the French with the British and American zones. On 23 May 1949, the Grundgesetz (Basic Law), the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany, was promulgated. Following elections in August, the first federal government was formed on 20 September 1949, by Konrad Adenauer (CDU). Adenauer's government was a coalition of the CDU, the CSU and the Free Democrats. The next day, the occupation statute came into force, granting powers of self-government with certain exceptions.</p>\n                        <p>In 1949 the new provisional capital of the Federal Republic of Germany was established in Bonn, after Chancellor Konrad Adenauer intervened emphatically for Bonn (which was only fifteen kilometers away from his hometown). Most of the members of the German constitutional assembly (as well as the U.S. Supreme Command) had favored Frankfurt am Main where the Hessian administration had already started the construction of a plenary assembly hall. The Parlamentarischer Rat (interim parliament) proposed a new location for the capital, as Berlin was then a special administrative region controlled directly by the allies and surrounded by the Soviet zone of occupation. The former Reichstag building in Berlin was occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the Bundesversammlung, the body which elects the German Federal President. However, the Soviets disrupted the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany by flying supersonic jets near the building. A number of cities were proposed to host the federal government, and Kassel (among others) was eliminated in the first round. Other politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that, as one of the largest German cities and a former centre of the Holy Roman Empire, it would be accepted as a \"permanent\" capital of Germany, thereby weakening the West German population's support for reunification and the eventual return of the Government to Berlin.</p>\n                        <p>After the Petersberg agreement West Germany quickly progressed toward fuller sovereignty and association with its European neighbors and the Atlantic community. The London and Paris agreements of 1954 restored most of the state's sovereignty (with some exceptions) in May 1955 and opened the way for German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In April 1951, West Germany joined with France, Italy and the Benelux countries in the European Coal and Steel Community (forerunner of the European Union).</p>\n                        <p>The outbreak of the Korean War (June 1950) led to U.S. calls for the rearmament of West Germany in order to defend western Europe from the perceived Soviet threat. But the memory of German aggression led other European states to seek tight control over the West German military. Germany's partners in the Coal and Steel Community decided to establish a European Defence Community (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.</p>\n                        <p>Though the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's Gaullists rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the French National Assembly refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French had killed their own proposal. Other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, the Brussels Treaty was modified to include West Germany, and to form the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm, and have full sovereign control of its military; the WEU would, however, regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Fears of a return to Nazism, however, soon receded, and as a consequence, these provisions of the WEU treaty have little effect today.</p>\n                        <p>Between 1949 and 1960, the West German economy grew at an unparalleled rate.[citation needed] Low rates of inflation, modest wage increases and a quickly rising export quota made it possible to restore the economy and brought a modest prosperity. According to the official statistics the German gross national product grew in average by about 7% annually between 1950 and 1960.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>GNP growth 1950-1960</h4>\n                        <p>The initial demand for housing, the growing demand for machine tools, chemicals, and automobiles and a rapidly increasing agricultural production were the initial triggers to this 'Wirtschaftswunder' (economic miracle) as it was known, although there was nothing miraculous about it. The era became closely linked with the name of Ludwig Erhard, who led the Ministry of Economics during the decade. Unemployment at the start of the decade stood at 10.3%, but by 1960 it had dropped to 1.2%, practically speaking full employment. In fact, there was a growing demand for labor in many industries as the workforce grew by 3% per annum, the reserves of labor were virtually used up.[39]:36 The millions of displaced persons and the refugees from the eastern provinces had all been integrated into the workforce. At the end of the decade, thousands of younger East Germans were packing their bags and migrating westwards, posing an ever-growing problem for the GDR nomenclature. With the construction of the Berlin wall in August 1961 they hoped to end the loss of labor and in doing so they posed the West German government with a new problem—how to satisfy the apparently insatiable demand for labor. The answer was to recruit unskilled workers from Southern European countries; the era of the Gastarbeiter (foreign laborers) began.</p>\n                        <p>In October 1961 an initial agreement was signed with the Turkish government and the first Gastarbeiter began to arrive. By 1966, some 1,300,000 foreign workers had been recruited mainly from Italy, Turkey, Spain, and Greece. By 1971, the number had reached 2.6 million workers. The initial plan was that single workers would come to Germany, would work for a limited number of years and then return home. The significant differences between wages in their home countries and in Germany led many workers to bring their families and to settle—at least until retirement—in Germany. That the German authorities took little notice of the radical changes that these shifts of population structure meant was the cause of considerable debate in later years.</p>\n                        <p>In the 1950s Federal Republic, restitution laws for compensation for those who had suffered under the Nazis was limited to only those who had suffered from \"racial, religious or political reasons\", which were defined in such a way as to sharply limit the number of people entitled to collect compensation.[40]:564 According to the 1953 law on compensation for suffering during the National Socialist era, only those with a territorial connection with Germany could receive compensation for their suffering, which had the effect of excluding the millions of people, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe, who had been taken to Germany to work as slave labor during World War II.[40]:565 In the same vein, to be eligible for compensation they would have to prove that they were part of the \"realm of German language and culture\", a requirement that excluded most of the surviving slave laborers who did not know German or at least enough German to be considered part of the \"realm of German language and culture\".[40]:567 Likewise, the law excluded homosexuals, Gypsies, Communists, Asoziale (\"Asocials\" - people considered by the National Socialist state to be anti-social, a broad category comprising anyone from petty criminals to people who were merely eccentric and non-conformist), and homeless people for their suffering in the concentration camps under the grounds that all these people were \"criminals\" whom the state was protecting German society from by sending them to concentration camps, and in essence these victims of the National Socialist state got what they deserved, making them unworthy of compensation.[40]:564, 565 In this regard it is significant[according to whom?] that the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 was not repealed until 1969.[41] As a result, German homosexuals - in many cases survivors of the concentration camps - between 1949 and 1969 continued to be convicted under the same law that had been used to convict them between 1935 and 1945, though in the period 1949–69 they were sent to prison rather than to a concentration camp.</p>\n                        <p>A study done in 1953 showed that of the 42,000 people who had survived the Buchenwald concentration camp, only 700 were entitled to compensation under the 1953 law.[40]:564 The German historian Alf Lüdtke wrote that the decision to deny that the Roma and the Sinti had been victims of National Socialist racism and to exclude the Roma and Sinti from compensation under the grounds that they were all \"criminals\" reflected the same anti-Gypsy racism that made them the target of persecution and genocide during the National Socialist era.[40]:565, 568–69 The cause of the Roma and Sinti excited so little public interest that it was not until 1979 that a group was founded to lobby for compensation for the Roma and the Sinti survivors.[40]:568–569 Communist concentration camp survivors were excluded from compensation under the grounds that in 1933 the KPD had been seeking \"violent domination\" by working for a Communist revolution, and thus the banning of the KPD and the subsequent repression of the Communists were justified.[40]:564 In 1956, the law was amended to allow Communist concentration camp survivors to collect compensation provided that they had not been associated with Communist causes after 1945, but as almost all the surviving Communists belonged to the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime, which had been banned in 1951 by the Hamburg government as a Communist front organisation, the new law did not help many of the KPD survivors.[40]:565–566 Compensation started to be paid to most Communist survivors regardless if they had belonged to the VVN or not following a 1967 court ruling, through the same court ruling had excluded those Communists who had \"actively\" fought the constitutional order after the banning of the KPD again in 1956.[40]:565–566 Only in the 1980s were demands made mostly from members of the SPD, FDP and above all the Green parties that the Federal Republic pay compensation to the Roma, Sinti, gay, homeless and Asoziale survivors of the concentration camps.</p>\n                        <p>In regards to the memory of the Nazi period in the 1950s Federal Republic, there was a marked tendency to argue that everyone regardless of what side they had been on in World War II were all equally victims of the war.[40]:561 In the same way, the Nazi regime tended to be portrayed in the 1950s as a small clique of criminals entirely unrepresentative of German society who were sharply demarcated from the rest of German society or as the German historian Alf Ludtke argued in popular memory that it was a case of \"us\" (i.e ordinary people) ruled over by \"them\" (i.e. the Nazis).[40]:561–62 Though the Nazi regime itself was rarely glorified in popular memory, in the 1950s World War II and the Wehrmacht were intensely gloried and celebrated by the public.[42]:235 In countless memoirs, novels, histories, newspaper articles, films, magazines, and Landserheft (a type of comic book in Germany glorifying war), the Wehrmacht was celebrated as an awesome, heroic fighting force that had fought a \"clean war\" unlike the SS and which would have won the war as the Wehrmacht was always portrayed as superior to the Allied forces had not been for mistakes on the part of Hitler or workings of \"fate\".[42]:235 The Second World War was usually portrayed in heavily romantic aura in various works that celebrated the comradeship and heroism of ordinary soldiers under danger with the war itself being shown as \"...a great adventure for idealists and daredevils...\" who for the most part had a thoroughly fun time.[42]:235 The tendency in the 1950s to glorify war by depicting World War II as a fun-filled, grand adventure for the men who served in Hitler's war machine meant the horrors and hardship of the war were often downplayed. In his 2004 essay \"Celluloid Soldiers\" about post-war German films, the Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that German films of the 1950s always showed the average German soldier as a heroic victim: noble, tough, brave, honourable and patriotic, while fighting hard in a senseless war for a regime that he did not care for.[43] Commendations of the victims of the Nazis tended to center around honoring those involved in the July 20 putsch attempt of 1944, which meant annual ceremonies attended by all the leading politicians at the Bendlerblock and Plötzensee Prison to honor those executed for their involvement in the 20 July putsch.[40]:554–555 By contrast, almost no ceremonies were held in the 1950s at the ruins of the concentration camps like Bergen-Belsen or Dachau, which were ignored and neglected by the Länder governments in charge of their care.[40]:555 Not until 1966 did the Land of Lower Saxony opened Bergen-Belsen to the public by founding a small \"house of documentation\", and even then it was in response to criticism that the Lower Saxon government was intentionally neglecting the ruins of Bergen-Belsen.[40]:555 Though it was usually claimed at the time that everybody in the Second World War was a victim, Ludtke commented that the disparity between the millions of Deutsche Marks spent in the 1950s in turning the Benderblock and Plötzensee prison into sites of remembrance honoring those conservatives executed after the 20 July putsch versus the neglect of the former concentration camps suggested that in both official and popular memory that some victims of the Nazis were considered more worthy of remembrance than others.[40]:554–555 It was against this context where popular memory was focused on glorifying the heroic deeds of the Wehrmacht while treating the genocide by the National Socialist regime as almost a footnote that in the autumn of 1959 that the philosopher Theodor W. Adorno gave a much-publicized speech on TV that called for Vergangenheitsbewältigung (\"coming to terms with the past\").[40]:550 Adorno stated that most people were engaged in a process of \"willful forgetting\" about the Nazi period and used euphemistic language to avoid confronting the period such as the use of the term Kristallnacht (Crystal Night) for the pogrom of November 1938.[40]:550 Adorno called for promoting a critical \"consciousness\" that would allow people to \"come to terms with the past\".</p>\n                        <p>West German authorities made great efforts to end the denazification process that had been started by the occupying powers and to liberate war criminals from prison, including those that had been convicted at the Nuremberg trials, while demarcating the sphere of legitimate political activity against blatant attempts at a political rehabilitation of the Nazi regime.</p>\n                        <p>Until the end of occupation in 1990, the three Western Allies retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 45,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)</p>\n                        <p>Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The Adenauer era (1949–63) was followed by a brief period under Ludwig Erhard (1963–66) who, in turn, was replaced by Kurt Georg Kiesinger (1966–69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by coalitions of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller Free Democratic Party (FDP).</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>The Sixties: a time for reform</h4>\n                        <p>The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged—almost literally—out of office in 1963. In 1959, it was time to elect a new President and Adenauer decided that he would place Erhard in this office. Erhard was not enthusiastic, and to everybody's surprise, Adenauer decided at the age of 83 that he would take on the position. His aim was apparently to remain in control of German politics for another ten years despite the growing mood for change, but when his advisers informed him just how limited the powers of the president were he quickly lost interest.[39]:3 An alternative candidate was needed and eventually the Minister of Agriculture, Heinrich Lübke took on the task and was duly elected.</p>\n                        <p>In October 1962, the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel published an analysis of the West German military defense. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of Der Spiegel in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized under the orders of the CSU Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the Bundestag that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, Rudolf Augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of Franz Josef Strauss, Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis by his heavy-handed attempt to silence Der Spiegel for essentially running a story that was unflattering to him (which incidentally was true).[45] The British historian Frederick Taylor argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian \"deep state\" that existed under the Weimar Republic, and that the Der Spiegel affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian values in favor of the more democratic values that are today seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic.[45] Adenauer's own reputation was impaired by Spiegel affair and he announced that he would step down in the autumn of 1963. His successor was to be the Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard, who was the man widely credited as the father of the \"economic miracle\" of the 1950s and of whom great things were expected.</p>\n                        <p>The proceedings of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but, a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people. In 1963, a German court ruled that a KGB assassin named Bohdan Stashynsky who had committed several murders in the Federal Republic in the late 1950s was not legally guilty of murder, but was only an accomplice to murder as the responsibility for Stashynsky's murders rested only with his superiors in Moscow who had given him his orders.[42]:245 The legal implications of the Stashynsky case, namely that in a totalitarian system only executive decision-makers can be held legally responsible for any murders committed and that anyone else who follows orders and commits murders were just accomplices to murder was to greatly hinder the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the coming decades, and ensured that even when convicted, that Nazi criminals received the far lighter sentences reserved for accomplices to murders than the harsher sentences given to murderers.[42]:245 The term executive decision-maker who could be found guilty of murder was reserved by the courts only for those at the highest levels of the Reich leadership during the Nazi period.[42]:245 The only way that a Nazi criminal could be convicted of murder was to show that they were not following orders at the time and had acted on their initiative when killing someone.[46] One courageous attorney, Fritz Bauer patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz death camp and about twenty were put trial in Frankfurt between 1963-1965 in what came to be known as the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials. The men on trial in Frankfurt were tried only for murders and other crimes that they committed on their own initiative at Auschwitz and were not tried for anything that they did at Auschwitz when following orders, which was considered by the courts to be the lesser crime of accomplice to murder.[46] Because of this, Bauer could only indict for murder those who killed when not following orders, and those who had killed when following orders were indicted as accomplices to murder. Moreover because of the legal distinction between murderers and accomplices to murder, an SS man who killed thousands while operating the gas chambers at Auschwitz could only be found guilty of being accomplice to murder because he had been following orders, while an SS man who had beaten one inmate to death on his initiative could be convicted of murder because he had not been following orders.[46] Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the Shoah was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term 'Holocaust' for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1943 in a New York Times piece that references \"the hundreds and thousands of European Jews still surviving the Nazi holocaust\". The term came into widespread use to describe the event following the TV film Holocaust in 1978) The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.</p>\n                        <p>In the early sixties, the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962, the growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate petered into a recession, with no growth in 1967. The economic showdown forced Erhard's resignation in 1966 and he was replaced with Kurt Georg Kiesinger of the CDU. Kiesinger was to attract much controversy because in 1933 he had joined the National Socialist Legal Guild and NSDAP (membership in the former was necessary in order to practice law, but membership in the latter was entirely voluntary).</p>\n                        <p>In order to deal with the problem of the economic slowdown, a new coalition was formed. Kiesinger's 1966–69 grand coalition was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts—the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency.</p>\n                        <p>During the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the Free Democratic Party, the rising German student movement, a group calling itself Notstand der Demokratie (Democracy in Crisis), the Außerparlamentarische Opposition and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament. The late 1960s saw the rise of the student movement and university campuses in a constant state of uproar. A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967 when the Shah of Iran visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as 'Jubelperser'), armed with staves and bricks, attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the center was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head and killed by a plain-clothed policeman Karl-Heinz Kurras. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German Stasi security forces.)[citation needed] Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the tabloid Bild-Zeitung newspaper, to be acts of terrorism. The conservative Bild-Zeitung waged a massive campaign against the protesters who were declared to be just hooligans and thugs in the pay of East Germany. The press baron Axel Springer emerged as one of the principal hate figures for the student protesters because of Bild-Zeitung's often violent attacks on them. Protests against the US intervention in Vietnam, mingled with anger over the vigor with which demonstrations were repressed, led to mounting militancy among the students at the universities of Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called Rudi Dutschke who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.[47] In the wake of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of their parents' generation in the Nazi era.</p>\n                        <p>In 1968, the Bundestag passed a Misdemeanors Bill dealing with traffic misdemeanors, into which a high-ranking civil servant named Dr. Eduard Dreher who had been drafting the bill inserted a prefatory section to the bill under a very misleading heading that declared that henceforth there was a statute of limitations of 15 years from the time of the offense for the crime of being an accomplices to murder which was to apply retroactively, which made it impossible to prosecute war criminals even for being accomplices to murder since the statute of limitations as now defined for the last of the suspects had expired by 1960.[42]:249 The Bundestag passed the Misdemeanors Bill without bothering to read the bill in its entirety so its members missed Dreher's amendment.[42]:249 It was estimated in 1969 that thanks to Dreher's amendment to the Misdemeanors Bill that 90% of all Nazi war criminals now enjoyed total immunity from prosecution.[42]:249–50 The prosecutor Adalbert Rückerl who headed the Central Bureau for the Prosecution of National Socialist Crimes told an interviewer in 1969 that this amendment had done immense harm to the ability of the Bureau to prosecute those suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>\n                        <p>The calling in question of the actions and policies of the government led to a new climate of debate by the late 1960s. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979, the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1979, a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account. Parallel to this, a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities, especially in West Berlin, where homosexuality had been widely accepted during the twenties in the Weimar Republic. In 1969, the Bundestag repealed the 1935 Nazi amendment to Paragraph 175, which not only made homosexual acts a felony, but had also made any expressions of homosexuality illegal (before 1935 only gay sex had been illegal). However, Paragraph 175 which made homosexual acts illegal remained on the statute books and was not repealed until 1994, although it had been softened in 1973 by making gay sex illegal only with those under the age of 18.</p>\n                        <p>Anger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke, coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims, led to growing militancy among students and their supporters. In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt; they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the 'struggle against imperialism'.[47] The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the Maoists and supporters of direct action in every form—the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalizing the industrial workers and, taking an example from activities in Italy of the Brigade Rosse, many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the 'Baader-Meinhof Group', later known as the Red Army Faction, which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. The \"Baader-Meinhof gang\" was committed to the overthrow of the Federal Republic via terrorism in order to achieve the establishment of a Communist state. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name \"RAF\". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Political developments 1969-1990</h4>\n                        <p>In the 1969 election, the SPD—headed by Willy Brandt—gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.

Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality.[citation needed] Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four-Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972).[39]:32 These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long term, to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over East-Central Europe. During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970, Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time. Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after Günter Guillaume, a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi. Brandt's contributions to world peace led to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 1971.</p>\n                        <p>Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) formed a coalition and he served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to \"the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA\".[49] Throughout the 1970s, the Red Army Faction had continued its terrorist campaign, assassinating or kidnapping politicians, judges, businessmen, and policemen. The highpoint of the RAF violence came with the German Autumn in autumn 1977. The industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer was kidnapped on 5 September 1977 in order to force the government to free the imprisoned leaders of the Baader-Meinhof Gang. A group from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked Lufthansa Flight 181 to seize further hostages to free the RAF leaders. On 18 October 1977, the Lufthansa jet was stormed in Mogadishu by the GSG 9 commando unit, who were able to free the hostages. The same day, the leaders of the Baader-Meinhof gang, who had been waging a hunger strike, were found dead in their prison cells with gunshot wounds, which led to Schleyer being executed by his captors. The deaths were controversially ruled suicides.[50] The Red Army Faction was to continue its terrorist campaign into the 1990s, but the German Autumn of 1977 was the highpoint of its campaign. That the Federal Republic had faced a crisis caused by a terrorist campaign from the radical left without succumbing to dictatorship as many feared that it would, was seen as vindication of the strength of German democracy.</p>\n                        <p>In January 1979, the American mini-series Holocaust aired in West Germany.[40]:543 The series, which was watched by 20 million people or 50% of West Germans, first brought the matter of the genocide in World War II to widespread public attention in a way that it had never been before.[40]:545–6 After each part of Holocaust was aired, there was a companion show where a panel of historians could answer questions from people phoning in.[40]:544–6 The historians' panels were literally overwhelmed with thousands of phone calls from shocked and outraged Germans, a great many of whom stated that they were born after 1945 and that was the first time that they learned that their country had practiced genocide in World War II.[40]:545–6 By the late 1970s, an initially small number of young people had started to demand that the Länder governments stop neglecting the sites of the concentration camps, and start turning them into proper museums and sites of remembrance, turning them into \"locations of learning\" meant to jar visitors into thinking critically about the Nazi period.</p>\n                        <p>In 1980, the CDU/CSU ran Strauss as their joint candidate in the elections, and he was crushingly[clarification needed] defeated by Schmidt. In October 1982, the SPD-FDP coalition fell apart when the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU chairman Helmut Kohl as Chancellor in a Constructive Vote of No Confidence. Genscher continued as Foreign Minister in the new Kohl government. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote. In 1983, despite major protests from peace groups, the Kohl government allowed Pershing II missiles to be stationed in the Federal Republic to counter the deployment of the SS-20 cruise missiles by the Soviet Union in East Germany. In 1985, Kohl, who had something of a tin ear when it came to dealing with the Nazi past,[clarification needed] caused much controversy when he invited President Ronald Reagan of the United States to visit the war cemetery at Bitburg to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II. The Bitburg cemetery was soon revealed to contain the graves of SS men, which Kohl stated that he did not see as a problem and that to refuse to honor all of the dead of Bitburg including the SS men buried there was an insult to all Germans. Kohl stated that Reagan could come to the Federal Republic to hold a ceremony to honor the dead of Bitburg or not come at all, and that to change the venue of the service to another war cemetery that did not have SS men buried in it was not acceptable to him. Even more controversy was caused by Reagan's statement that all of the SS men killed fighting for Hitler in World War II were \"just kids\" who were just as much the victims of Hitler as those who been murdered by the SS in the Holocaust.[51] Despite the huge controversy caused by honoring the SS men buried at Bitburg, the visit to Bitburg went ahead, and Kohl and Reagan honored the dead of Bitburg. What was intended to promote German-American reconciliation turned out to be a public relations disaster that had the opposite effect. Public opinion polls showed that 72% of West Germans supported the service at Bitburg while American public opinion overwhelming disapproved of Reagan honoring the memory of the SS men who gave their lives for Hitler.</p>\n                        <p>Despite or perhaps because of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a campaign had been started to build a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin.[40]:557 It was felt by at least some Germans that there was something wrong about the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters.[40]:557 In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built.[40]:557 Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.</p>\n                        <p>In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by Hans-Jochen Vogel. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%. Later in 1987, Kohl had a summit with the East German leader Erich Honecker. Unknown to Kohl, the meeting room had been bugged by the Stasi, and the Stasi tapes of the summit had Kohl saying to Honecker that he did not see any realistic chance of reunification in the foreseeable future.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>East Germany</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn05\" disabled=\"\">Summary</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn06\">Industry and agriculture in East Germany</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\">\n                        <h4>Summary</h4>\n                        <p>In the Soviet occupation zone, the Social Democratic Party was forced to merge with the Communist Party in April 1946 to form a new party, the Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands or SED). The October 1946 elections resulted in coalition governments in the five Land (state) parliaments with the SED as the undisputed leader.</p>\n                        <p>A series of people's congresses were called in 1948 and early 1949 by the SED. Under Soviet direction, a constitution was drafted on 30 May 1949, and adopted on 7 October, the day when East Germany was formally proclaimed. The People's Chamber (Volkskammer)—the lower house of the East German parliament—and an upper house—the States Chamber (Länderkammer)—were created. (The Länderkammer was abolished again in 1958.) On 11 October 1949, the two houses elected Wilhelm Pieck as President, and an SED government was set up. The Soviet Union and its East European allies immediately recognized East Germany, although it remained largely unrecognized by noncommunist countries until 1972–73. East Germany established the structures of a single-party, centralized, totalitarian communist state. On 23 July 1952, the traditional Länder were abolished and, in their place, 14 Bezirke (districts) were established. Even though other parties formally existed, effectively, all government control was in the hands of the SED, and almost all important government positions were held by SED members.</p>\n                        <p>The National Front was an umbrella organization nominally consisting of the SED, four other political parties controlled and directed by the SED, and the four principal mass organizations—youth, trade unions, women, and culture. However, control was clearly and solely in the hands of the SED. Balloting in East German elections was not secret. As in other Soviet bloc countries, electoral participation was consistently high, as the following results indicate. In October 1950, a year after the formation of the GDR, 98.53% of the electorate voted. 99.72% of the votes were valid and 99.72% were cast in favor of the 'National Front'—the title of the 'coalition' of the Unity Party plus their associates in other conformist groups. In election after election, the votes cast for the Socialist Unity Party were always over 99%, and in 1963, two years after the Berlin Wall was constructed, the support for the S.E.D. was 99.95%. Only 0.05% of the electorate opposed the party according to these results, the veracity of which is disputable.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Industry and agriculture in East Germany</h4>\n                        <p>With the formation of a separate East German communist state in October 1949, the Socialist Unity Party faced a huge range of problems. Not only were the cities in ruins, much of the productive machinery and equipment had been seized by the Soviet occupation force and transported to The Soviet Union in order to make some kind of reconstruction possible. While West Germany received loans and other financial assistance from the United States, the GDR was in the role of an exporter of goods to the USSR—a role that its people could ill afford but which they could not avoid.</p>\n                        <p>The S.E.D.'s intention was to transform the GDR into a socialist and later into a communist state. These processes would occur step by step according to the laws of scientific 'Marxism-Leninism' and economic planning was the key to this process. In July 1952, at a conference of the S.E.D., Walter Ulbricht announced that \"the democratic (sic) and economic development, and the consciousness (Bewusstsein) of the working class and the majority of the employed classes must be developed so that the construction of Socialism becomes their most important objective.\"[53]:453 This meant that the administration, the armed forces, the planning of industry and agriculture would be under the sole authority of the S.E.D. and its planning committee. Industries would be nationalized and collectivization introduced in the farm industry. When the first Five-Year Plan was announced, the flow of refugees out of East Germany began to grow. As a consequence, production fell, food became short and protests occurred in a number of factories. On 14 May 1952, the S.E.D. ordered that the production quotas (the output per man per shift) were to be increased by 10%, but wages to be kept at the former level. This decision was not popular with the new leaders in the Kremlin. Stalin had died in March 1953 and the new leadership was still evolving. The imposition of new production quotas contradicted the new direction of Soviet policies for their satellites.</p>\n                        <p>On 5 June 1953, the S.E.D. announced a 'new course' in which farmers, craftsmen, and factory owners would benefit from a relaxation of controls. The new production quotas remained; the East German workers protested and up to sixty strikes occurred the following day. One of the window-dressing projects in the ruins of East Berlin was the construction of Stalin Allee, on which the most 'class-conscious' workers (in S.E.D. propaganda terms) were involved. At a meeting, strikers declared \"You give the capitalists (the factory owners) presents, and we are exploited!\"[53]:455 A delegation of building workers marched to the headquarters of the S.E.D. demanding that the production quotas be rescinded. The crowd grew, demands were made for the removal of Ulbricht from office and a general strike called for the following day.</p>\n                        <p>On 17 June 1953 strikes and demonstrations occurred in 250 towns and cities in the GDR. Between 300,000 and 400,000 workers took part in the strikes, which were specifically directed towards the rescinding of the production quotas and were not an attempt to overthrow the government. The strikers were for the most part convinced that the transformation of the GDR into a socialist state was the proper course to take but that the S.E.D. had taken a wrong turn.[53]:457 The S.E.D. responded with all of the force at its command and also with the help of the Soviet Occupation force. Thousands were arrested, sentenced to jail and many hundreds were forced to leave for West Germany. The S.E.D. later moderated its course but the damage had been done. The real face of the East German regime was revealed. The S.E.D. claimed that the strikes had been instigated by West German agents, but there is no evidence for this. Over 250 strikers were killed, around 100 policemen and some 18 Soviet soldiers died in the uprising;[53]:459 17 June was declared a national day of remembrance in West Germany.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec04\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn07\" disabled=\"\">Division of Germany</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn08\">Elimination of war potential and reparations</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn09\">Berlin</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn10\">Relations between East Germany and West Germany</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn11\">The reunification of East Germany and West Germany</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art07\">\n                        <h4>Division of Germany</h4>\n                        <h5>Four occupation zones</h5>\n                        <p>At the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945), after Germany's unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945,[6] the Allies officially divided Germany into the four military occupation zones — France in the Southwest, the United Kingdom in the Northwest, the United States in the South, and the Soviet Union in the East, bounded Eastwards by the Oder-Neisse line. At Potsdam these four zones in total were denoted as 'Germany as a whole', and the four Allied Powers exercised the sovereign authority they now claimed within Germany in agreeing 'in principle' the future transfer of lands of the former German Reich east of 'Germany as a whole' to Poland and the Soviet Union.[7] These eastern areas were notionally placed under Polish and Soviet administration pending a final peace treaty (which was not formalized until 1990, 45 years later); but in actuality were promptly reorganized as organic parts of their respective sovereign states.</p>\n                        <p>In addition, under the Allies' Berlin Declaration (1945), the territory of the extinguished German Reich was to be treated as the land area within its borders as of 31 December 1937. All land expansion from 1938 to 1945 was hence treated as automatically invalid. Such expansion included the League of Nations administered City-State of Danzig (occupied by Germany immediately following Germany's 1 September 1939 invasion of Poland), Austria, the occupied territory of Czechoslovakia, Suwalki, Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg, post 27 September 1939 \"West Prussia\", post 27 September 1939 \"Posen Province\", northern Slovenia, Eupen, Malmedy, the part of Southern Silesia ultimately detached from 1918 Germany by action of the Versailles Treaty, likewise, the Hultschiner Laendchen.</p>\n                        <h5>Flight and expulsion of ethnic Germans</h5>\n                        <p>The northern half of East Prussia in the region of Königsberg was administratively assigned by the Potsdam Agreement to the Soviet Union, pending a final Peace Conference (with the commitment of Britain and the United States to support its incorporation into Russia); and was then annexed by the Soviet Union. The Free City of Danzig and the southern half of East Prussia were incorporated into and annexed by Poland; the Allies having assured the Polish government-in-exile of their support for this after the Tehran Conference in 1943. It was also agreed at Potsdam that Poland would receive all German lands East of the Oder-Neisse line, although the exact delimitation of the boundary was left to be resolved at an eventual Peace Conference. Under the wartime alliances of the United Kingdom with the Czechoslovak and Polish governments-in-exile, the British had agreed in July 1942 to support \"...the General Principle of the transfer to Germany of German minorities in Central and South Eastern Europe after the war in cases where this seems necessary and desirable\". In 1944 roughly 12.4 million ethnic Germans were living in territory that became part of post-war Poland and Soviet Union. Approximately 6 million fled or were evacuated before the Red Army occupied the area. Of the remainder, around 2 million died during the war or in its aftermath (1.4 million as military casualties; 600,000 as civilian deaths),[8] 3.6 million were expelled by the Poles, one million declared themselves to be Poles, and 300,000 remained in Poland as Germans. The Sudetenland territories, surrendered to Germany by the Munich Agreement, were returned to Czechoslovakia; these territories containing a further 3 million ethnic Germans. 'Wild' expulsions from Czechoslovakia began immediately after the German surrender.</p>\n                        <p>The Potsdam Conference subsequently sanctioned the \"orderly and humane\" transfer to Germany of individuals regarded as \"ethnic Germans\" by authorities in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. The Potsdam Agreement recognized that these expulsions were already underway and were putting a burden on authorities in the German Occupation Zones, including the re-defined Soviet Occupation Zone. Most of the Germans who were being expelled were from Czechoslovakia and Poland, which included most of the territory to the east of the Oder-Neisse Line. The Potsdam Declaration stated:</p>\n                        <p>Since the influx of a large number of Germans into Germany would increase the burden already resting on the occupying authorities, they consider that the Allied Control Council in Germany should in the first instance examine the problem with special regard to the question of the equitable distribution of these Germans among the several zones of occupation. They are accordingly instructing their respective representatives on the control council to report to their Governments as soon as possible the extent to which such persons have already entered Germany from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, and to submit an estimate of the time and rate at which further transfers could be carried out, having regard to the present situation in Germany. The Czechoslovak Government, the Polish Provisional Government and the control council in Hungary are at the same time being informed of the above and are being requested meanwhile to suspend further expulsions pending the examination by the Governments concerned of the report from their representatives on the control council.</p>\n                        <p>Many of the ethnic Germans, who were primarily women and children, and especially those under the control of Polish and Czechoslovakian authorities, were severely mistreated before they were ultimately deported to Germany. Thousands died in forced labor camps such as Lambinowice, Zgoda labour camp, Central Labour Camp Potulice, Central Labour Camp Jaworzno, Glaz, Milecin, Gronowo, and Sikawa.[9] Others starved, died of disease, or froze to death while being expelled in slow and ill-equipped trains; or in transit camps.</p>\n                        <p>Altogether, around 8 million ethnic German refugees and expellees from across Europe eventually settled in West Germany, with a further 3 million in East Germany. In West Germany these represented a major voting block; maintaining a strong culture of grievance and victimhood against Soviet Power, pressing for a continued commitment to full German reunification, claiming compensation, pursuing the right of return to lost property in the East, and opposing any recognition of the postwar extension of Poland and the Soviet Union into former German lands.[10] Owing to the Cold War rhetoric and successful political machinations of Konrad Adenauer, this block eventually became substantially aligned with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany; although in practice 'westward-looking' CDU policies favouring the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union worked against the possibility of achieving the objectives of the expellee population from the east through negotiation with the Soviet Union. But for Adenauer, fostering and encouraging unrealistic demands and uncompromising expectations amongst the expellees would serve his \"Policy of Strength\" by which West Germany contrived to inhibit consideration of unification or a final Peace Treaty until the West was strong enough to face the Soviets on equal terms. Consequently, the Federal Republic in the 1950s adopted much of the symbolism of expellee groups; especially in appropriating and subverting the terminology and imagery of the Holocaust; applying this to post-war German experience instead.[11] Eventually in 1990, following the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany, the unified Germany indeed confirmed in treaties with Poland and the Soviet Union that the transfer of sovereignty over the former German eastern territories in 1945 had been permanent and irreversible; Germany now undertaking never again to make territorial claims in respect of these lands.</p>\n                        <p>The intended governing body of Germany was called the Allied Control Council, consisting of the commanders-in-chief in Germany of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union; who exercised supreme authority in their respective zones, while supposedly acting in concert on questions affecting the whole country. In actuality however, the French consistently blocked any progress towards re-establishing all-German governing institutions; substantially in pursuit of French aspirations for a dismembered Germany, but also as a response to the exclusion of France from the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. Berlin, which lay in the Soviet (eastern) sector, was also divided into four sectors with the Western sectors later becoming West Berlin and the Soviet sector becoming East Berlin, capital of East Germany.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art08\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Elimination of war potential and reparations</h4>\n                        <h5>Denazification</h5>\n                        <p>A key item in the occupiers' agenda was denazification. The swastika and other outward symbols of the Nazi regime were banned, and a Provisional Civil Ensign was established as a temporary German flag. It remained the official flag of the country (necessary for reasons of international law) until East Germany and West Germany (see below) were independently established in 1949.</p>\n                        <p>The United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union had agreed at Potsdam to a broad program of decentralization, treating Germany as a single economic unit with some central administrative departments. These plans never materialised, initially because France blocked any establishment of central administrative or political structures for Germany; and also as both the Soviet Union and France were intent on extracting as much material benefit as possible from their occupation zones in order to make good in part the enormous destruction caused by the German Wehrmacht; and the policy broke down completely in 1948 when the Russians blockaded West Berlin and the period known as the Cold War began. It was agreed at Potsdam that the leading members of the Nazi regime who had been captured should be put on trial accused of crimes against humanity, and this was one of the few points on which the four powers were able to agree. In order to secure the presence of the western allies in Berlin, the United States agreed to withdraw from Thuringia and Saxony in exchange for the division of Berlin into four sectors.</p>\n                        <p>Future President and General Dwight D. Eisenhower and the US War Department initially implemented a strict non-fraternization policy between the US troops and German citizens. The State Department and individual US congressmen pressured to have this policy lifted. In June 1945 the prohibition against speaking with German children was loosened. In July troops were permitted to speak to German adults in certain circumstances. In September 1945 the entire policy was dropped. Only the ban on marriage between Americans and German or Austrian civilians remained in place until 11 December 1946 and 2 January 1946 respectively.</p>\n                        <h5>Industrial disarmament in western Germany</h5>\n                        <p>The initial proposal for the post-surrender policy of the Western powers, the so-called Morgenthau Plan proposed by Henry Morgenthau, Jr., was one of \"pastoralization\".[13] The Morgenthau Plan, though subsequently ostensibly shelved due to public opposition, influenced occupation policy; most notably through the U.S. punitive occupation directive JCS 1067[14][15] and The industrial plans for Germany</p>\n                        <p>The \"Level of Industry plans for Germany\" were the plans to lower German industrial potential after World War II. At the Potsdam conference, with the U.S. operating under influence of the Morgenthau plan,[16] the victorious Allies decided to abolish the German armed forces as well as all munitions factories and civilian industries that could support them. This included the destruction of all ship and aircraft manufacturing capability. Further, it was decided that civilian industries which might have a military potential, which in the modern era of \"total war\" included virtually all, were to be severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's \"approved peacetime needs\", which were defined to be set on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements.</p>\n                        <p>The first plan, from 29 March 1946, stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants.[17] In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production—the maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year, equivalent to 25% of the prewar production level.[18] The UK, in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located, had argued for a more limited capacity reduction by placing the production ceiling at 12 million tons of steel per year, but had to submit to the will of the U.S., France and the Soviet Union (which had argued for a 3 million ton limit). Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known at the height of the Great Depression (1932).[19] Car production was set to 10% of pre-war levels, etc.</p>\n                        <p>By 1950, after the virtual completion of the by then much watered-down plans, equipment had been removed from 706 factories in the west and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6,700,000 tons.</p>\n                        <p>Timber exports from the U.S. occupation zone were particularly heavy. Sources in the U.S. government stated that the purpose of this was the \"ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests.\"</p>\n                        <p>With the beginning of the Cold War, the Western policies changed as it became evident that a return to operation of the West German industry was needed not only for the restoration of the whole European economy but also for the rearmament of West Germany as an ally against the Soviet Union. On 6 September 1946 United States Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes made the famous speech Restatement of Policy on Germany, also known as the Stuttgart speech, where he amongst other things repudiated the Morgenthau plan-influenced policies and gave the West Germans hope for the future. Reports such as The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria helped to show the U.S. public how bad the situation in Germany really was.</p>\n                        <p>The next improvement came in July 1947, when after lobbying by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Generals Clay and Marshall, the Truman administration decided that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent.[22] In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on \"national security grounds\"[22] the punitive occupation directive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces in Germany to \"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany.\" It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that \"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\"</p>\n                        <p>The dismantling did however continue, and in 1949 West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer wrote to the Allies requesting that it end, citing the inherent contradiction between encouraging industrial growth and removing factories and also the unpopularity of the policy.[24]:259 Support for dismantling was by this time coming predominantly from the French, and the Petersberg Agreement of November 1949 reduced the levels vastly, though dismantling of minor factories continued until 1951. The final limitations on German industrial levels were lifted after the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, though arms manufacture remained prohibited.</p>\n                        <h5>French designs</h5>\n                        <p>Under the Monnet Plan, France—intent on ensuring that Germany would never again have the strength to threaten it—began in 1945 to attempt to gain economic control of the remaining German industrial areas with large coal and mineral deposits; the Rhineland, the Ruhr and the Saar (Germany's second largest center of mining and industry, Upper Silesia, had been handed over by the Allies to Poland at the Potsdam conference and the German population was being forcibly expelled).[25] The Ruhr Agreement had been imposed on the Germans as a condition for permitting them to establish the Federal Republic of Germany.[26] (see also the International Authority for the Ruhr (IAR)). French attempts to gain political control of or permanently internationalize the Ruhr were abandoned in 1951 with the West German agreement to pool its coal and steel resources in return for full political control over the Ruhr (see European Coal and Steel Community). With French economic security guaranteed through access to Ruhr coal now permanently ensured France was satisfied. The French attempt to gain economic control over the Saar was temporarily even more successful.</p>\n                        <p>In the speech Restatement of Policy on Germany, held in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946, the United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes stated the U.S. motive in detaching the Saar from Germany as \"The United States does not feel that it can deny to France, which has been invaded three times by Germany in 70 years, its claim to the Saar territory\". The Saar came under French administration in 1947 as the Saar Protectorate, but did return to Germany in January 1957 (following a referendum), with economic reintegration with Germany occurring a few years later.</p>\n                        <p>Although not a party to the Potsdam conference where the policy of industrial disarmament had been set, as a member of the Allied Control Council France came to champion this policy since it ensured a weak Germany.</p>\n                        <p>In August 1954 the French parliament voted down the treaty that would have established the European Defense Community, a treaty they themselves had proposed in 1950 as a means to contain German revival. France instead focused on another treaty also under development. In May 1950 France had proposed the European Coal and Steel Community with the purpose of ensuring French economic security by perpetuating access to German Ruhr coal, but also to show to the U.S. and the UK that France could come up with constructive solutions, as well as to pacify Germany by making it part of an international project.</p>\n                        <p>Germany was eventually allowed to rearm, but under the auspices of the Western European Union, and later NATO.</p>\n                        <h5>Dismantling in East Germany</h5>\n                        <p>The Soviet Union engaged in a massive industrial dismantling campaign in its occupation zone, much more intensive than that carried out by the Western powers. While the Soviet powers soon realized that their actions alienated the German workforce from the Communist cause, they decided that the desperate economic situation within the Soviet Union took priority over alliance building. The allied leaders had agreed on paper to economic and political cooperation but the issue of reparations dealt an early blow to the prospect of a united Germany in 1945. The figure of $20 Billion had been floated by Stalin as an adequate recompense but as the United States refused to consider this a basis for negotiation The Soviet Union was left only with the opportunity of extracting its own reparations, at a heavy cost to the East Germans. This was the beginning of the formal split of Germany.</p>\n                        <h5>Marshall plan and currency reform</h5>\n                        <p>With the Western Allies eventually becoming concerned about the deteriorating economic situation in their \"Trizone\", the American Marshall Plan of economic aid was extended to Western Germany in 1948 and a currency reform, which had been prohibited under the previous occupation directive JCS 1067, introduced the Deutsche Mark and halted rampant inflation. Though the Marshall Plan is regarded as playing a key psychological role in the West German recovery, other factors were also significant.</p>\n                        <p>The Soviets had not agreed to the currency reform; in March 1948 they withdrew from the four-power governing bodies, and in June 1948 they initiated the Berlin blockade, blocking all ground transport routes between Western Germany and West Berlin. The Western Allies replied with a continuous airlift of supplies to the western half of the city. The Soviets ended the blockade after 11 months.</p>\n                        <h5>Reparations to the U.S.</h5>\n                        <p>The Allies confiscated intellectual property of great value, all German patents, both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.[28] Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the U.S. pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel comes to the conclusion, in his book \"Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany\", that the \"intellectual reparations\" taken by the U.S. and the UK amounted to close to $10 billion.[29][30] During the more than two years that this policy was in place, no industrial research in Germany could take place, as any results would have been automatically available to overseas competitors who were encouraged by the occupation authorities to access all records and facilities. Meanwhile, thousands of the best German scientists were being put to work in the U.S. (see also Operation Paperclip)</p>\n                        <h5>Nutritional levels and deliberate famine</h5>\n                        <p>During the war, Germans seized food supplies from occupied countries and forced millions of foreigners to work on German farms, in addition to food shipped from farms in eastern Germany. When this ended in 1945, the German rationing system (which stayed in place) had much lower supplies of food.[31]:342–54 The U.S. Army sent in large shipments of food to feed some 7.7 million prisoners of war—far more than they had expected[31]:200—as well as the general population.[32] For several years following the surrender, German nutritional levels were low. The Germans were not high on the priority list for international aid, which went to the victims of the Nazis.[33]:281 It was directed that all relief went to non-German displaced persons, liberated Allied POWs, and concentration camp inmates.[33]:281–82 During 1945 it was estimated that the average German civilian in the U.S. and UK occupation zones received 1200 kilocalories a day in official rations, not counting food they grew themselves or purchased on the large-scale black market.[33]:280 In early October 1945 the UK government privately acknowledged in a cabinet meeting that German civilian adult death rates had risen to 4 times the pre-war levels and death rates amongst the German children had risen by 10 times the pre-war levels.[33]:280 The German Red Cross was dissolved, and the International Red Cross and the few other allowed international relief agencies were kept from helping Germans through strict controls on supplies and on travel.[33]:281–82 The few agencies permitted to help Germans, such as the indigenous Caritasverband, were not allowed to use imported supplies. When the Vatican attempted to transmit food supplies from Chile to German infants, the U.S. State Department forbade it.[33]:281 The German food situation became worse during the very cold winter of 1946–1947 when German calorie intake ranged from 1,000–1,500 kilocalories per day, a situation made worse by severe lack of fuel for heating.</p>\n                        <h5>Forced labour reparations</h5>\n                        <p>As agreed by the Allies at the Yalta conference Germans were used as forced labor as part of the reparations to be extracted. German prisoners were for example forced to clear minefields in France and the Low Countries. By December 1945 it was estimated by French authorities that 2,000 German prisoners were being killed or injured each month in accidents.[34] In Norway the last available casualty record, from 29 August 1945, shows that by that time a total of 275 German soldiers died while clearing mines, while 392 had been injured.</p>\n                        <h5>Mass rape</h5>\n                        <p>Norman Naimark writes in The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945–1949 that although the exact number of women and girls who were raped by members of the Red Army in the months preceding and years following the capitulation will never be known, their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, quite possibly as high as the 2,000,000 victims estimate made by Barbara Johr, in \"Befreier und Befreite\". Many of these victims were raped repeatedly. Naimark states that not only had each victim to carry the trauma with her for the rest of her days, it inflicted a massive collective trauma on the East German nation (the German Democratic Republic). Naimark concludes \"The social psychology of women and men in the Soviet zone of occupation was marked by the crime of rape from the first days of occupation, through the founding of the GDR in the fall of 1949, until—one could argue—the present.\"[36] Some of the victims had been raped as many as 60 to 70 times[dubious – discuss].[37] According to German historian Miriam Gebhardt, as many as 190,000 women were raped by U.S. soldiers in Germany.</p>\n                        <h5>German states</h5>\n                        <p>On 16 February 1946, the Saar Protectorate had been established under French control, in the area corresponding to the current German state of Saarland. It was not allowed to join its fellow German neighbors until a plebiscite in 1955 rejected the proposed autonomy. This paved the way for the accession of the Saarland to the Federal Republic of Germany as its 12th state, which went into effect on 1 January 1957.</p>\n                        <p>On 23 May 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, Bundesrepublik Deutschland) was established on the territory of the Western occupied zones, with Bonn as its \"provisional\" capital. It comprised the area of 11 newly formed states (replacing the pre-war states), with present-day Baden-Württemberg being split into three states until 1952). The Federal Republic was declared to have \"the full authority of a sovereign state\" on 5 May 1955. On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR, Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR)), with East Berlin as its capital, was established in the Soviet Zone.</p>\n                        <p>The 1952 Stalin Note proposed German reunification and superpower disengagement from Central Europe but Britain, France, and the United States rejected the offer as insincere. Also, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer preferred \"Westintegration\", rejecting \"experiments\".</p>\n                        <p>In English, the two larger states were known informally as \"West Germany\" and \"East Germany\" respectively. In both cases, the former occupying troops remained permanently stationed there. The former German capital, Berlin, was a special case, being divided into East Berlin and West Berlin, with West Berlin completely surrounded by East German territory. Though the German inhabitants of West Berlin were citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany, West Berlin was not legally incorporated into West Germany; it remained under the formal occupation of the western allies until 1990, although most day-to-day administration was conducted by an elected West Berlin government.</p>\n                        <p>West Germany was allied with the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. A western democratic country with a \"social market economy\", the country would from the 1950s onwards come to enjoy prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) following the Marshall Plan help from the Allies, the currency reform of June 1948 and helped by the fact that the Korean War (1950–53) led to a worldwide increased demand for goods, where the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products.</p>\n                        <p>East Germany was at first occupied by and later (May 1955) allied with the Soviet Union.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art09\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Berlin</h4>\n                        <p>Shortly after World War II, Berlin became the seat of the Allied Control Council, which was to have governed Germany as a whole until the conclusion of a peace settlement. In 1948, however, the Soviet Union refused to participate any longer in the quadripartite administration of Germany. They also refused to continue the joint administration of Berlin and drove the government elected by the people of Berlin out of its seat in the Soviet sector and installed a communist regime in East Berlin. From then until unification, the Western Allies continued to exercise supreme authority—effective only in their sectors—through the Allied Kommandatura. To the degree compatible with the city's special status, however, they turned over control and management of city affairs to the West Berlin Senate and the House of Representatives, governing bodies established by constitutional process and chosen by free elections. The Allies and German authorities in West Germany and West Berlin never recognized the communist city regime in East Berlin or East German authority there.</p>\n                        <p>During the years of West Berlin's isolation—176 kilometers (110 mi.) inside East Germany—the Western Allies encouraged a close relationship between the Government of West Berlin and that of West Germany. Representatives of the city participated as non-voting members in the West German Parliament; appropriate West German agencies, such as the supreme administrative court, had their permanent seats in the city; and the governing mayor of West Berlin took his turn as President of the Bundesrat. In addition, the Allies carefully consulted with the West German and West Berlin Governments on foreign policy questions involving unification and the status of Berlin.</p>\n                        <p>Between 1948 and 1990, major events such as fairs and festivals were sponsored in West Berlin, and investment in commerce and industry was encouraged by special concessionary tax legislation. The results of such efforts, combined with effective city administration and the West Berliners' energy and spirit, were encouraging. West Berlin's morale was sustained, and its industrial production considerably surpassed the pre-war level.</p>\n                        <p>The Final Settlement Treaty ended Berlin's special status as a separate area under Four Power control. Under the terms of the treaty between West and East Germany, Berlin became the capital of a unified Germany. The Bundestag voted in June 1991 to make Berlin the seat of government. The Government of Germany asked the Allies to maintain a military presence in Berlin until the complete withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces (ex-Soviet) from the territory of the former East Germany. The Russian withdrawal was completed 31 August 1994. Ceremonies were held on 8 September 1994, to mark the final departure of Western Allied troops from Berlin.</p>\n                        <p>Government offices have been moving progressively to Berlin, and it became the formal seat of the federal government in 1999. Berlin also is one of the Federal Republic's 16 Länder.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art10\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Relations between East Germany and West Germany</h4>\n                        <p>Under Chancellor Adenauer, West Germany declared its right to speak for the entire German nation with an exclusive mandate. The Hallstein Doctrine involved non-recognition of East Germany and restricted (or often ceased) diplomatic relations with countries that gave East Germany the status of a sovereign state.</p>\n                        <p>The constant stream of East Germans fleeing across the Inner German border to West Germany placed great strains on East German-West German relations in the 1950s. East Germany sealed the borders to West Germany in 1952, but people continued to flee from East Berlin to West Berlin. On 13 August 1961, East Germany began building the Berlin Wall around West Berlin to slow the flood of refugees to a trickle, effectively cutting the city in half and making West Berlin an enclave of the Western world in communist territory. The Wall became the symbol of the Cold War and the division of Europe. Shortly afterward, the main border between the two German states was fortified.</p>\n                        <p>The Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops of 1965 was controversial at the time, but is now seen as an important step toward improving relations between the German states and Poland.</p>\n                        <p>In 1969, Chancellor Willy Brandt announced that West Germany would remain firmly rooted in the Atlantic alliance but would intensify efforts to improve relations with the Eastern Bloc, especially East Germany. West Germany commenced this Ostpolitik, initially under fierce opposition from the conservatives, by negotiating nonaggression treaties with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary.</p>\n                        <p>West Germany's relations with East Germany posed particularly difficult questions. Though anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, West Germany under Brandt's Ostpolitik was intent on holding to its concept of \"two German states in one German nation.\" Relations gradually improved. In the early 1970s, the Ostpolitik led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both states joining the United Nations in September 1973. The two German states exchanged permanent representatives in 1974, and, in 1987, East German head of state Erich Honecker paid an official visit to West Germany.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art11\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>The reunification of East Germany and West Germany</h4>\n                        <h5>Background</h5>\n                        <p>International plans for the unification of Germany were made during the early years following the establishment of the two states, but to no avail. In March 1952, the Soviet government proposed the Stalin Note to hold elections for a united German assembly while making the proposed united Germany a neutral state, i.e. a neutral state approved by the people, similar to the Austrians' approval of a neutral Austria. The Western Allied governments refused this initiative, while continuing West Germany's integration into the Western alliance system. The issue was raised again during the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin in January–February 1954, but the western powers refused to make Germany neutral. Following Bonn's adherence to NATO on 9 May 1955, such initiatives were abandoned by both sides.</p>\n                        <p>During the summer of 1989, rapid changes took place in East Germany, which ultimately led to German reunification. Widespread discontent boiled over, following accusations of large scale vote-rigging during the local elections of May 1989. The beginning of the end of Eastern Germany was the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989. The event, which goes back to an idea by Otto von Habsburg, caused the mass exodus of GDR citizens, the media-informed East German population felt the loss of power of their rulers, and the Iron Curtain started to break down completely. Erich Honecker explained to the Daily Mirror regarding the Paneuropean picnic and thus showed his people his own inaction: \"Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.\"[54][55][56] Growing numbers of East Germans emigrated to West Germany via Hungary after the Hungarians decided not to use force to stop them. Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and mass demonstrations (Monday demonstrations) with eventually hundreds of thousands of people in several cities—particularly in Leipzig—continued to grow. On 7 October, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited Berlin to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of East Germany and urged the East German leadership to pursue reform, without success. The movement of civil resistance against the East German regime—both the emigration and the demonstrations—continued unabated.</p>\n                        <p>On 18 October, Erich Honecker was forced to resign as head of the SED and as head of state and was replaced by Egon Krenz. But the exodus continued unabated, and pressure for political reform mounted. On 4 November, a demonstration in East Berlin drew as many as 1 million East Germans. Finally, on 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall was opened, and East Germans were allowed to travel freely. Thousands poured through the wall into the western sectors of Berlin, and on 12 November, East Germany began dismantling it.</p>\n                        <p>On 28 November, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl outlined the 10-Point Plan for the peaceful unification of the two German states, based on free elections in East Germany and a unification of their two economies. In December, the East German Volkskammer eliminated the SED monopoly on power, and the entire Politbüro and Central Committee—including Krenz—resigned. The SED changed its name to the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and the formation and growth of numerous political groups and parties marked the end of the communist system. Prime Minister Hans Modrow headed a caretaker government which shared power with the new, democratically oriented parties. On 7 December 1989, an agreement was reached to hold free elections in May 1990 and rewrite the East German constitution. On 28 January, all the parties agreed to advance the elections to 18 March, primarily because of an erosion of state authority and because the East German exodus was continuing apace; more than 117,000 left in January and February 1990.</p>\n                        <p>In early February 1990, the Modrow government's proposal for a unified, neutral German state was rejected by Chancellor Kohl, who affirmed that a unified Germany must be a member of NATO. Finally, on 18 March, the first free elections were held in East Germany, and a government led by Lothar de Maizière (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany. The freely elected representatives of the Volkskammer held their first session on 5 April, and East Germany peacefully evolved from a communist to a democratically elected government. Free and secret communal (local) elections were held in the GDR on 6 May, and the CDU again won most of the available seats. On 1 July, the two German states entered into an economic and monetary union.</p>\n                        <h5>Treaty negotiations</h5>\n                        <p>During 1990, in parallel with internal German developments, the Four Powers—the Allies of World War II, being the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union—together with the two German states negotiated to end Four Power reserved rights for Berlin and Germany as a whole. These \"Two-plus-Four\" negotiations were mandated at the Ottawa Open Skies conference on 13 February 1990. The six foreign ministers met four times in the ensuing months in Bonn (5 May), Berlin (22 June), Paris (17 July), and Moscow (12 September). The Polish Foreign Minister participated in the part of the Paris meeting that dealt with the Polish-German borders.</p>\n                        <p>Overcoming Soviet objections to a united Germany's membership in NATO was of key importance. This was accomplished in July when the alliance, led by President George H.W. Bush, issued the London Declaration on a transformed NATO. On 16 July, President Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl announced the agreement in principle on a united Germany in NATO. This cleared the way for the signing in Moscow, on 12 September, of the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany—in effect the peace treaty that was anticipated at the end of World War II. In addition to terminating Four Power rights, the treaty mandated the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Germany by the end of 1994, made clear that the current borders (especially the Oder-Neisse line) were viewed as final and definitive, and specified the right of a united Germany to belong to NATO. It also provided for the continued presence of British, French, and American troops in Berlin during the interim period of the Soviet withdrawal. In the treaty, the Germans renounced nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and stated their intention to reduce the (combined) German armed forces to 370,000 within 3 to 4 years after the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, signed in Paris on 19 November 1990, entered into force.</p>\n                        <p>The conclusion of the final settlement cleared the way for the unification of East and West Germany. Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990, preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany's Basic Law (meaning that constitutionally, East Germany was subsumed into West Germany); but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990, which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990.[58] These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law (including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession). On 2 December 1990, all-German elections were held for the first time since 1933. The \"new\" country stayed the same as the West German legal system and institutions were extended to the east. The unified nation kept the name Bundesrepublik Deutschland (though the simple 'Deutschland' would become increasingly common) and retained the West German \"Deutsche Mark\" for currency as well. Berlin would formally become the capital of the united Germany, but the political institutions remained at Bonn for the time being. Only after a heated 1991 debate did the Bundestag conclude on moving itself and most of the government to Berlin as well, a process that took until 1999 to complete, when the Bundestag held its first session at the reconstructed Reichstag building. Many government departments still maintain sizable presences in Bonn as of 2008.</p>\n                        <h5>Aftermath</h5>\n                        <p>To this day, there remain vast differences between the former East Germany and West Germany (for example, in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs, and other matters) and thus it is still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly. The eastern German economy has struggled since unification, and large subsidies are still transferred from west to east.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">West Germany, East Germany</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Federal Republic of Germany, German Democratic Republic</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">1949–1990</h2>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_weg.png\" style=\"width: 90%;

It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the Alps to the south; covering an area of 357,022 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi), with a population of over 83 million within its 16 constituent states. It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and largest city is Berlin, and its financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.</p>\n                   <p>Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation-state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, Germany was divided into the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, East Germany. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communism, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990—becoming a federal parliamentary republic led by a chancellor.</p>\n                   <p>Germany is a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe, the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. As a developed country, which ranks very high on the Human Development Index, it offers social security and a universal health care system, environmental protections, and a tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20, and the OECD. It has the fourth-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec02\">\n                    <h3>Geography</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn01\" disabled=\"\">Summary</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn02\">Climate</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn03\">Biodiversity</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art01\">\n                        <h4>Summary</h4>\n                        <p>Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe;[4] bordering Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, and Switzerland to the south-southwest. France, Luxembourg and Belgium are situated to the west, with the Netherlands to the northwest. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,022 km2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 348,672 km2 (134,623 sq mi) of land and 8,350 km2 (3,224 sq mi) of water.</p>\n                        <p>Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[108]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art02\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Climate</h4>\n                        <p>Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to mild and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.</p>\n                        <p>From February 2019 – 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[110] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[111] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[112] The highest temperature ever recorded in Germany was 42.6 °C on 25 July 2019 in Lingen and the lowest was −37.8 °C on 12 February 1929 in Wolnzach.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art03\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Biodiversity</h4>\n                        <p>The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[115] As of 2016 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.</p>\n                        <p>Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[117] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[118] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.</p>\n                        <p>The 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[120] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[121] and 105 nature parks.[122] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[123] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec03\">\n                    <h3>Politics</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn04\" disabled=\"\">Summary</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn05\">Law</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn06\">Foreign relations</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn07\">Military</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art04\">\n                        <h4>Summary</h4>\n                        <p>Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.</p>\n                        <p>The president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (president of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[126] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] The chancellor, currently Angela Merkel, is the head of government and exercises executive power through their Cabinet.</p>\n                        <p>Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance '90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the left-wing populist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art05\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Law</h4>\n                        <p>Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[135] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[136] Germany's supreme court system is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.</p>\n                        <p>Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[138] Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (Schöffen) sit side by side with professional judges.</p>\n                        <p>Germany has a low murder rate with 1.18 murders per 100,000 as of 2016.[141] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art06\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Foreign relations</h4>\n                        <p>Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[144] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[145] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G8, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[146][147][148] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[149] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.</p>\n                        <p>The development policy of Germany is an independent area of foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[151] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art07\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Military</h4>\n                        <p>Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, is organised into the Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force), Zentraler Sanitätsdienst der Bundeswehr (Joint Medical Service) and Streitkräftebasis (Joint Support Service) branches. In absolute terms, German military expenditure is the 8th highest in the world.[153] In 2018, military spending was at $49.5 billion, about 1.2% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%.</p>\n                        <p>As of January 2020, the Bundeswehr has a strength of 184,001 active soldiers and 80,947 civilians.[156] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[157] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[158][159] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[160] According to SIPRI, Germany was the fourth largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2014 to 2018.</p>\n                        <p>In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[162] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term \"defence\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017, the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec04\">\n

<h4>Summary</h4>\n                        <p>Germany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption, and a high level of innovation.[4][166][167] It is the world's third largest exporter of goods,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe, which is also the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP,[168] and the fifth-largest by PPP.[169] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average (100%).[170] The service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%, and agriculture 1% as of 2017.[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January 2020, which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.</p>\n                        <p>Germany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[172] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the Eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[173] Germany introduced the common European currency, the Euro, in 2002.[174] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt.</p>\n                        <p>Being home to the modern car, the automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[176] and is the fourth largest by production.[177] The top 10 exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics.[178] Germany is one of the largest exporters globally.</p>\n                        <p>Of the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2019, the Fortune Global 500, 29 are headquartered in Germany.[180] 30 major Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index which is operated by Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[181] Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Porsche, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom.[182] Berlin is a hub for startup companies and has become the leading location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union.[183] Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the Mittelstand model.[184] These companies represent 48% global market leaders in their segments, labelled Hidden Champions.</p>\n                        <p>Research and development efforts form an integral part of the German economy.[186] In 2018 Germany ranked fourth globally in terms of number of science and engineering research papers published.[187] Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association, and the Fraunhofer Society and the Leibniz Association.[188] Germany is the largest contributor to the European Space Agency.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art09\"

network is among the densest in Europe.[191] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[192] The InterCityExpress or ICE train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[193] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport.[194] The Port of Hamburg is one of the top twenty largest container ports in the world.</p>\n                        <p>In 2015, Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[196] The government and the nuclear power industry agreed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2021.[197] It meets the country's power demands using 40% renewable sources.[198] Germany is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[199][200][201] The country's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%.[202] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth highest in the EU in 2018.[203] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art10\" style=\"display: none;\">\n

Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (588 per square mile). The overall life expectancy in Germany at birth is 80.19 years (77.93 years for males and 82.58 years for females).[4] The fertility rate of 1.41 children born per woman (2011 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s, particularly a rise in the number of well-educated migrants. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.</p>\n                        <p>Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[211] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[211] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.</p>\n                        <p>After the United States, Germany is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. The majority of migrants live in western Germany, in particular in urban areas. Of the country's residents, 18.6 million people (22.5%) were of immigrant or partially immigrant descent in 2016 (including persons descending or partially descending from ethnic German repatriates).[212] In 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[213] As of 2018, Germany ranks fifth amongst EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 12.9%.</p>\n                        <p>Germany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art12\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Religion</h4>\n                        <p>The 2011 German Census showed Christianity as the largest religion in Germany, with 66.8% identified themselves as Christian, with 3.8% of those not being church members.[216] 31.7% declared themselves as Protestants, including members of the Evangelical Church in Germany (which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions) and the free churches (German: Evangelische Freikirchen); 31.2% declared themselves as Roman Catholics, and Orthodox believers constituted 1.3%. According to data from 2016, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church claimed 28.5% and 27.5%, respectively, of the population.[217][218] Islam is the second largest religion in the country.[219] In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this religion (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[220] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.</p>\n                        <p>A study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination,[221] though up to a third may still consider themselves religious. Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art13\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Languages</h4>\n                        <p>German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.[224] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission.[225] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.</p>\n                        <p>Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romany, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan languages and Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art14\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Education</h4>\n                        <p>Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[227] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[228] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[227] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.</p>\n                        <p>Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[230] The general requirement for university is the Abitur. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[231] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest.[232] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[233][234] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art15\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Health</h4>\n                        <p>Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenhäuser, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[236] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization, Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013.[237] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.</p>\n                        <p>Germany ranked 20th in the world in 2013 in life expectancy with 77 years for men and 82 years for women, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[239] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec06\">\n                    <h3>Culture</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn16\" disabled=\"\">Summary</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn17\">Music</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn18\">Art and design</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn19\">Literature and philosophy</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn20\">Media</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn21\">Cuisine</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn22\">Sports</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art16\">\n                        <h4>Summary</h4>\n                        <p>Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically, Germany has been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker (\"the land of poets and thinkers\"),[241] because of the major role its writers and philosophers have played in the development of Western thought.[242] A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.</p>\n                        <p>Germany is well known for such folk festival traditions as Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[245][246] As of 2016 UNESCO inscribed 41 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[247] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art17\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Music</h4>\n                        <p>German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>\n                        <p>As of 2013, Germany was the second largest music market in Europe, and fourth largest in the world.[250] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[251] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art18\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Art and design</h4>\n                        <p>German painters have influenced western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.</p>\n                        <p>Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[253] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[254] When industrialisation spread across Europe, Classicism and a distinctive style of historism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[253] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[255] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.</p>\n                        <p>German designers became early leaders of modern product design.[257] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread &amp; Butter are held twice a year.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art19\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Literature and philosophy</h4>\n                        <p>German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[259] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.</p>\n                        <p>Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass.[261] The German book market is the third largest in the world, after the United States and China.[262] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[263] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.</p>\n                        <p>German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; the development of the Frankfurt School has been particularly influential.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art20\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Media</h4>\n                        <p>The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are the Bertelsmann enterprise, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media.

The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film). East German film was dominated by state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm (\"homeland film\").[269] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.</p>\n                        <p>The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum) in 1979, to Nirgendwo in Afrika (Nowhere in Africa) in 2002, and to Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art21\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Cuisine</h4>\n                        <p>German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities (e.g. the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia share some traditions with Switzerland and Austria). International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine and doner kebab are also popular.</p>\n                        <p>Bread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen).[271] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[272] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[273] The national alcoholic drink is beer. German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[274] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[275] Wine is becoming more popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[276] In 2019, Germany was the ninth largest wine producer in the world.</p>\n                        <p>The 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art22\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Sports</h4>\n                        <p>Football is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[279] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[280] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[281] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[282] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.</p>\n                        <p>Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of 2017).[284] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[285] Sebastian Vettel is also among the top five most successful Formula One drivers of all time.</p>\n                        <p>Historically, German athletes have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count (when combining East and West German medals). Germany was the last country to host both the summer and winter games in the same year, in 1936: the Berlin Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.[287] Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"sec07\">\n                    <h3>History</h3>\n                    <div class=\"selection_menu\">\n                        <button id=\"btn23\" disabled=\"\">Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn24\">East Francia and Holy Roman Empire</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn25\">German Confederation and Empire</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn26\">Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn27\">East and West Germany</button>\n                        <button id=\"btn28\">Reunified Germany and the European Union</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art23\">\n                        <h4>Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire</h4>\n                        <p>The Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age.[19] From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.</p>\n                        <p>Under Augustus, Rome began to invade Germania. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius.[21] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[22][23][24] Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[25] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria, and areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art24\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>East Francia and Holy Roman Empire</h4>\n                        <p>Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843[26] and the Holy Roman Empire emerged from the eastern portion. The territory initially known as East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe River in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[26] The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[27] In 996 Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.</p>\n                        <p>Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung). Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[29] Population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50.[30] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.</p>\n                        <p>Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[32] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[33] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.</p>\n                        <p>The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates;[34] their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, or the Reformed faith as their official religion.[36] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[37] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as Empress Consort when her husband, Francis I, became Emperor.</p>\n                        <p>From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[40][41] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art25\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>German Confederation and Empire</h4>\n                        <p>Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[43][44] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[45] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German Question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.</p>\n                        <p>King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.</p>\n                        <p>In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[48] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[49] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[50] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[51] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[52] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[53][54] this was the 20th century's first genocide.</p>\n                        <p>The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[55] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[56] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the South Sea.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art26\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany</h4>\n                        <p>On 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[58] In the subsequent struggle for power, communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements elsewhere attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch. Street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops, and a period of hyperinflation followed. A debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.</p>\n                        <p>The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932.[62] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler won a special election in 1932 and Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.[63] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[64][65] The Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution;[66] his government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[67] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the autobahn.</p>\n                        <p>In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[69] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[70] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[71] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.</p>\n                        <p>In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[73] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[74] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[75] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and her allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the allies' reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.[74][76] Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.</p>\n                        <p>In what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. In total 17 million people were systematically murdered, including 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 persons with disabilities, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[79] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[80] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[81][77] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[82] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[83] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art27\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>East and West Germany</h4>\n                        <p>After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[86] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.</p>\n                        <p>West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan.[88] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[89] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.</p>\n                        <p>East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[91] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[92] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.</p>\n                        <p>Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[94] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[95] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, German Reunification and Die Wende.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"art28\" style=\"display: none;\">\n                        <h4>Reunified Germany and the European Union</h4>\n                        <p>United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[97] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[98] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the east German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.</p>\n                        <p>Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[101] and co-founding the Eurozone.[102] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.</p>\n                        <p>In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009 the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[105] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the \"Debt Brake\" for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[106] Germany was affected by the European migrant crisis in 2015: the country took in over a million migrants and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its states.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </div>\n            <div id=\"main_info\">\n                <h1 id=\"info_title\">Germany</h1>\n                <h3 id=\"info_other_title\">Federal Republic of Germany</h3>\n                <h2 id=\"info_year\">1990-2021</h2>\n                <img id=\"info_flag\" src=\"media/img/flag_ger.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Flag of Germany</p>\n                <table id=\"info_capital\" class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Capital</th>\n                        <td>Berlin</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <ol>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec01\">Germany</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec02\">Geography</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec03\">Politics</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec04\">Economy</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec05\">Domographics</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec06\">Culture</a></li>\n                    <li><a href=\"#sec07\">History</a></li>\n                </ol>\n                <hr>\n                <h4>Geographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Area</th>\n                        <td>357,022 km<sup>2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Time Zones</th>\n                        <td>UTC+1</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <img id=\"info_map\" src=\"media/img/map_ger.png\">\n                <p id=\"info_flag_desc\">Map Germany</p>\n                <h4>Demographics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Population</th>\n                        <td>83,166,711</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Religion</th>\n                        <td><ul>\n                            <li>Non-religious (~34%)</li>\n                            <li>Protestant (31.7%)</li>\n                            <li>Roman Catholic (31.2%)</li>\n                            <li>Islam (1.9%)</li>\n                        </ul></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Languages</th>\n                        <td>German</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Currency</th>\n                        <td>Euro</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <h4>Politics</h4>\n                <table class=\"info_table\">\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <th>Goverment</th>\n                        <td>Federal parliamentary republic</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Leaders</th>\n                        <td>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Frank-Walter Steinmeier (President)</li>\n                                <li>Angela Merkel (Chancellor)</li>\n                                <li>Olaf Scholz (Vice Chancellor)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n            </div>\n        "}
